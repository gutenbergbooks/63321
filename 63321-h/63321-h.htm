<p>The author did not live to revise the original
draft of &#8220;Mr. Waddy&#8217;s Return,&#8221; and therefore,
when his other novels were published, shortly after
his death, this one was not included. On looking it
over again, after the lapse of years, it seemed to his
sister, Miss Elizabeth W. Winthrop, too good to let
die; and it was placed in the hands of Mr. Stevenson
to give it such revision and condensation as it may
be presumed that the author, had he lived, would
have given it himself.</p>

<p class="ph1">MR. WADDY&#8217;S RETURN</p>
</div>



<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<span class="small">A REMARKABLE EPISODE, HITHERTO UNRECORDED,<br />
IN THE VOYAGE OF THE &#8220;MAYFLOWER&#8221;</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NAMES must act upon character. Every
preceding Waddy, save one short-lived Ira, from
the first ancestor, the primal Waddy, cook of the
<i>Mayflower</i>, had been a type of placid meekness,
of mild, humble endurance. During all Boston&#8217;s
material changes, from a petty colony under Winthrop
to a great city under General Jackson, and all
its spiritual changes from Puritanism to Unitarianism,
Boston divines had pointed to the representative
Waddy of their epoch as the worthy successor
of Moses upon earth&mdash;Moses the meekest man, not
Moses the stalwart smiter of rocks and irate iconoclast
of golden calves.</p>

<p>Why, then, was Ira Waddy, with whom this tale
is to concern itself, other than his race? Why had
he revolutionised the family history? Why was he
a captor, not a captive of Fate? Why was the
Waddy name no longer hid from the world in the
unfragrant imprisonment and musty gloom of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
blind court in Boston, but known and seen and
heard of all men, wherever tea-chests and clipper-ships
are found, or fire-crackers do pop? Why was
Ira Waddy, in all senses, the wholesale man, while
every other Waddy had been retail? Brief questions&mdash;to
be answered not so briefly in this history
of his Return.</p>

<p>Yes, the Waddy fortunes had altered. To the
small shop, the only patrimony of the Waddy family,
went little vulgar boys in days of Salem witchcraft,
in days of Dorchester sieges, and after when the
Fourth of July began to noise itself abroad as a
festival of the largest liberty: on all great festal
days when parents and uncles rattled with candy
money, and coppers were certain, and on all individual
festal days when the unlooked-for copper
came, then went brats, Whig and Tory, Federal
and Democrat, to the Waddys&#8217; shop and bullied
largely there. Not only the representative Mr.
Waddy did they bully and bargain into pecuniary
bewilderment and total loss of profit, but also the representative
Mrs. Waddy, a feeble, scrawny dame,
whose courage died when she put the fateful question
to the representative Mr. Waddy, otherwise
never her spouse.</p>

<p>But there was no more bullying about the little
shop. In fact, the shop had grown giantly with the
fortunes of the name. A row of stately warehouses
covered its site, and many other sites where neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
pride had once looked down upon it. The row
was built of granite, without ornament or gaud,
enduring as the eternal hills. On its front, cut in
solid letters on a gigantic block, were the words</p>


<p class="center"><span class="bbox">WADDY BUILDINGS</span></p>

<p>Ginger was sold there in dust-heaps like a Vesuvius,
not gingerbread in the amorphous penny idol;
aromatic cinnamon by the ceroons of a plundered
forest, not by the chewing-stick for dull Sabbath
afternoons; tea by the barricade of chests, product
of a province, not by the tin shoeful, as the old-time
Waddys had sold it for a century before the
Tea Party. And Ira Waddy owned these buildings,
which he had never seen.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that I should speculate to discover
where the traits that distinguished Ira Waddy
from his ancestors had their origin. Of this I have
accurate information. My wonder is at the delay
in a development of character certain to arrive.
But late springs bring scorching summers. Fires
battened long below hatches gather strength for one
swift leap to the main-truck.</p>

<p>Whitegift Waddy, cook of the <i>Mayflower</i>, was
meek. How he came to be a Puritan, on the <i>Mayflower</i>,
in its caboose and a cook,&mdash;out of his element
in religion, in space, in place, and in profession,&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
cannot say; these are questions that the Massachusetts
Historical Society will probably investigate,
now that the Waddys are rich and can hire cooks to
give society dinners. At all events, there he was, and
there he daily made a porridge for Miles Standish,
and there he peppered the same. Now as to pepper
in cream tarts there is question; in porridge none: I
do not, therefore, blame Miles, peppery himself and
loving pepper, for wrath when, one day, a bowl of
pepperless insipidity was placed before him. He
sent for the cook and thus addressed him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Milksop! Thou hast the pepper forgot. I
will teach thy caitiff life a lesson. Ho, trencherman!
Bring pepper!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was brought. He poured it all into the porridge,
and, standing by, compelled Waddy to swallow
spoonful after spoonful. At the screams of the
victim, the Pilgrim Grandfathers, Governor Carver,
Father Winslow, and Elder Brewster, rushed from
on deck into the cabin and besought the infuriated
hero to desist as he valued the life of Mrs. Susanna
White, who was soon to add a little Pilgrim to
their colony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough!&#8221; said Standish. &#8220;The pepper hath
entered into his soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had, indeed! Nothing was cooked on the <i>Mayflower</i>
for six days. On the seventh, Whitegift
Waddy re-entered the caboose. He had always been
a meek, he was now a crushed man. Yet there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
seemed to have grown within him, as we sometimes
see in those the world has wronged, a quiet confidence
in a redressing future.</p>

<p>Pepper, thus implanted in the Waddy nature,
seemed to have no effect for generations. It was,
however, slowly leavening their lumpishness. It was
impelling them to momentary tricks of a strange
vivacity. At last, the permeating was accomplished,
and our hero, Ira, the first really alive Waddy, was
born. I have said the first, but there was another
Ira Waddy who, at one period in his brief career,
showed a momentary sparkle of the smouldered
flame. Of him a word anon, as his fate had to do
with the fates of others, strangely interwoven with
the fate of his great-nephew and namesake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<span class="small">THE WADDYS OF DULLISH COURT, FROM WHITEGIFT<br />
TO OUR HERO</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHILE Governor Winthrop was planning the
future city of Boston, he went, one rainy
day, to the heights of those hills that give the spot
the name of Trimountain. A violent June storm
had channelled the hillsides, and strong water-courses
filled the valleys. No phenomenon is idle to
the observing mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;These channels,&#8221; said the prudent governor,
&#8220;shall be the streets of our future city.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then pursued his way downward, slipping
along the oozy trails, until he paused at a small
pool where several little, muddy rivulets united to
form a stagnancy. Here, he contemplated for a
while his grave but genial visage, and smiled as his reflected
face broadened or lengthened grotesquely and
his pointed beard wagged in the waves of the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said he at last, &#8220;shall be a place for
pauses in city life. Here shall be a no-thoroughfare
court, a lurking-place for shy respectability, for
proud poverty; not quite for neediness, but for those
who want and would, but will not.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>Boston was laid out; the streets named themselves.
This court chanced to be called Dulwich
Court, which soon degraded itself to Dullish, and
so it remained in nature and in name.</p>

<p>Whitegift Waddy, and Mehitabel, his wife, floating
purposeless waifs through the new settlements,
drifted into Dullish Court to live dull lives and then
to meekly die. There was always one son in each
generation of their family, an unwholesome lad, fed
on remainder biscuits and stale mince pies. Still,
it gradually became aristocratic to have come in with
the Pilgrims. A certain consideration began to attach
itself to the family, and the current Waddy, if
such phrase may be used of so very stagnant a person,
was always espoused by someone of a better
class than his social condition could warrant. It
was generally some pale schoolmistress, or invalided
housekeeper of a great mansion, who became
the better half of each gentle shopkeeper of Dullish
Court.</p>

<p>These wives brought refinement and education
with them; so that, at last, could they have sunk the
shop, the Waddys would have been admitted as
gentlefolk anywhere. They enjoyed, too, the consciousness
of being better in rank than their neighbours.
They never spoke of Whitegift as the cook,
but as the Steward, or sometimes the Purveyor, of
the <i>Mayflower</i>. They liked to walk through Beacon
Street and smile placidly at the efforts of new people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
to win position by great houses, crowded balls and
routs, and promotion marriages.</p>

<p>By-and-by it chanced that, quite contrary to rule,
there were three sons in one generation playing in
the puddles of Dullish Court and slyly filching dry
gingerbread from the showcases of the old shop.
It was a time when there was a flame in the land,
and the elder twin of the three young Waddys,
Whitegift by name, who had been early taken with
tin soldiers and penny trumpets, awoke one morning
after booziness to find himself, to his total surprise,
with a red coat on his back and a king&#8217;s
shilling in his pocket. There was so little real
martial ardour in his soul that he at once withered
away, and being sent to the garrison of New York
as a recruit of doubtful loyalty, he was there soon
invalided. He finally dropped into the family trade
and became a sutler. The Boston Waddys, saddened
by his desertion of a cause they had vigour
enough to support, soon forgot his existence&mdash;which
does not at all imply that such existence
terminated.</p>

<p>The other twin was apparently of the usual
Waddy type; but when the great flame blazed forth
at last unquenchable, he also took fire. He was a
volunteer at Lexington and did active service, dropping
several invaders in their bloody tracks. He
was at once made sergeant in Captain Janeway&#8217;s
company, and gained the respect of his officers by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
his quick, ready energy. Ira was his name&mdash;Ira
Waddy, the First.</p>

<p>Two months later, when the British were trying
that uphill work at Bunker Hill for the third time,
Captain Jane way and Sergeant Waddy waited
rather too long. Three or four of the British
rushed at Janeway with eyes staring for plunder.
One of them stared at what he got and lay there
staring, with his head down-hill. To bore this
fellow had occupied Janeway&#8217;s sword, and though
Sergeant Waddy&#8217;s clubbed musket could brain another
assailant, it could not parry two bayonet
thrusts. His breast could and did; so that Janeway
felt nothing more than a scratch, when, with a
murderous stamp of the left foot, another soldier
ran the sergeant through. Just then a rush of flying
Yankees came by and cleared the spot of foes.
The captain had a moment to kneel by his preserver
and hear him gasp some broken words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! Take care of them, captain. Oh,
Mary, Mary!&#8221;</p>

<p>When, after the surrender of Boston, Captain,
now Colonel, Janeway called on that Mary with the
news of her lover&#8217;s death and his last words, she
knew her life was widowed. There was nothing in
the power of a man of wealth and growing distinction
that the colonel did not offer her. She rejected
all with a New England woman&#8217;s quiet independence
and mild self-reliance. To become a schoolmistress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
as she did, was only to return to her original
destiny.</p>

<p>Janeway remained her friend. He alone knew
her secret. She was one of those strangely spiritual
beings who interfere like dreamy visions in the inventive,
busy business of Yankee life. She had a
great, ennobling sorrow. Her lover had been a
martyr of two religions. He had died for his
country and for his friend. It may be said he died
instinctively; but Mary knew that only the noble
and the brave have noble and brave instincts.</p>

<p>To most people, Mary was only a pale schoolmistress.
One person, however, met her on terms
of devoted respect. Governor Janeway, the pre-eminently
practical and successful man, found in her
society what he found not with his gorgeous wife.
She became the Cassandra of young Janeway&mdash;who
went to the bad, it is true, but long after her death&mdash;and
the kindly guide of his infant child.</p>

<p>Late in life she married Benajah Waddy, the
youngest brother of the three. Janeway had made
him bookkeeper, secretary, agent, but he had finally,
after his mother&#8217;s death, dwindled into the old shop.
Mary, considering herself his brother&#8217;s widow, came
to a Hebraical, religious conclusion as to her duty.
With entire simplicity of heart, she told Benajah
that they ought to be married. As a matter of
course, they were. The usual wife found, also, in
process of time, their only son, Benajah, and married<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
him. These both died, leaving their only son,
Ira Waddy, to the charge of his aged and widowed
grandmother, Mary, widow in heart of Ira the
First.</p>

<p>Her grandson was named Ira after his great-uncle,
the soldier. By-and-by it was discovered that
a wide river in India bore the same name, and
young Waddy was attracted toward his namesake.
The old influence which, now reviving, made his
blood hot as flame, urged him to know the land not
merely of the citron and myrtle, but of spice and
pungent condiments. His grandmother lavished
upon him all the beautiful tenderness of her long-suppressed
and desolated love, and then she died.</p>

<p>Ira Waddy&#8217;s hot ardency of nature could not bear
coolly any wrong. Wrong came to him. It would
have extinguished an ancestor of the Whitegift
class. Him it only kindled to counter-fire. He had
his great quarrel with life, as many men have; he, in
his young life. The Janeways had always been
kind to him; so had their neighbours, the Beldens.
In childish sports and youthful intercourse with the
children of both families, he had often talked with
enthusiasm of tropic splendours and India, his destined
abode. When the world of his early associations
became too narrow for him&mdash;too narrow because
there his wrong would meet and hurtle him
daily&mdash;then he thought again of India, and tropic
indolence, and thoughtless people. Being an orphan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and without kin, he could go where he chose. He
chose India.</p>

<p>There, as the years passed, he became rich and
powerful, a nabob, a merchant prince; but with all
that this tale has no concern&mdash;it is written merely to
chronicle the facts of his Return.</p>

<span class="small">IN WHICH MR. WADDY REACHES HALIFAX AND<br />
MEETS WITH A MISADVENTURE</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE <i>Niagara</i> was running into Halifax.</p>

<p>It was early of a bright summer morning, and
all the passengers came on deck, joyous with hopes
of <i>terra firma</i>. There was our hero, Mr. Ira
Waddy; there were two shipboard friends of his,
Harry Dunston and Gilbert Paulding; there was the
Budlong family, to wit: old De Flournoy Budlong;
Mrs. De Flournoy Budlong, his second wife, luxuriantly
handsome, and greatly his junior; Tim De
Flournoy Budlong, and Arabella De Flournoy Budlong;
and accompanying them was M. Auguste
Henri Miromenil de Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant.</p>

<p>They all looked fresh and well-dressed in shore
toggery. The Budlongs, particularly, were in full
bloom. They were always now in full bloom, and
meant the world should fully know they were returning
from Europe with fashion and the fashions,
with a gallery of pictures and a Parisian pronunciation.
Old Budlong had once been a brisk young
clerk, lively and lucky. He was called Flirney then.
He had traded in most things and all had yielded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
him pelf. He was now a capitalist, fat and uneasy,
with a natural jollity which he thought unbecoming
his position and endeavoured to suppress. Budlong
in full bloom was as formal as a ball bouquet.</p>

<p>It was under the r&eacute;gime of the second wife that
the Budlongs had blossomed. After one season of
gorgeous grandeur, but doubtful triumph, at home,
they, or rather the master-she of their social life,
determined to be stamped into undoubted currency
by the cachet of Europe and Paris. They went,
were <i>parisin&eacute;s</i>, and were now returning, wiser and
worse. They were now the De Flournoy B.&#8217;s, and
brought with them De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant, as attach&eacute; of
mother and step-daughter, either or both. Old Bud,
on marital and paternal grounds, disliked the Gaul.</p>

<p>Halifax is dull and provincial, but any land ho! is
charming after a voyage. Old Budlong knew all
about Mr. Waddy&#8217;s wealth and position. He had
lavished much of his style of civility, with much
sincere good will, upon him on board ship and now
was urgent that he should join the ladies and himself
in their promenade ashore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Waddy, &#8220;but I have promised
to take a tramp with your boy and these gentlemen,&#8221;
and he indicated Dunstan and Paulding.</p>

<p>So De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant carried the day. Old Budlong
walked in advance, inquiring the way, while
his wife and daughter followed, making a cheerful
glare of ankles through the muddy streets.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it delightful to be ashore?&#8221; remarked Miss
Arabella to Auguste Henri.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yese, mees. I am mose pleese to be out of ze
ice-bugs. Ah, mademoiselle,&#8221;&mdash;as Arabella made a
lofty lift over a puddle,&mdash;&#8220;vous avez le pied d&#8217;une
sylphide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy and his companions soon exhausted
the town. They lunched substantially on land fare,
and having still time, went to drive, Dunstan and
Paulding in one drag, Mr. Waddy and Tim in another.
The first signal-gun recalled them. The
two friends, whose steed was a comparative Bucephalus
to the others&#8217; Rosinante, drew rapidly out
of sight. The rear coachman was flogging his beast
into a clumsy canter, when just as they passed a
little jetty near some fishing-huts, they saw a child
fall from the end into deep water.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t let the child drown,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy,
stopping the coachman.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s none of ours. We must catch the ship.
Perhaps he can swim,&#8221; rejoined Timothy.</p>

<p>But it was evident he couldn&#8217;t; there was no other
help in sight. In an instant, Mr. Waddy was on the
jetty, coat, waistcoat, and hat off; in another, he was
fighting the tide for the drowning life.</p>

<p>Tim was no more selfish a fellow than is the rule
with the sons of such merchants, and especially such
step-mothers. He would, perhaps, have stayed by
Mr. Waddy had that gentleman been in positive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
danger, but seeing that he was not only not drowning,
but had the child safe by the hair, Tim whipped
up and got on board just in time.</p>

<p>Cunarders do not wait for passengers who choose
to go a-ducking after top-heavy children. Tim told
his story. Mrs. Budlong and most of the commercial
gentry rather laughed at Mr. Waddy. Dunstan
and Paulding said nothing to them. They,
however, seemed to have an opinion on the subject
which prevented them from any further interchange
of cigars with Master Timothy. Dunstan looked
up Chin Chin, Mr. Waddy&#8217;s Chinese servant, and
by dint of pulling his ears and cue and saying Hi
yah! a great many times, made him understand that
his master was left, and he, Chin Chin, must pack up
the traps, and for the present obey the cue-puller.</p>

<p>It was a very tender and beautiful thing to see
how Mr. Waddy raised the insensible boy up from
the boat below to the jetty. He wrapped the dripping
object without scruple in his own very neat and
knowing travelling jacket and carried him toward
the mother, who had seen the accident from a distance
and was running wildly toward them. She
clasped the child to her breast, and, at the beating of
her heart, life seemed suddenly to thrill through the
saved one. He opened his eyes and smiled through
his gasping agony.</p>

<p>Then the mother turned, seized Mr. Waddy in an
all-round embrace, and gave him a stout fisherwoman&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
smack. It was a first-class salute for the returning
hero.</p>

<p>He disentangled himself from this codfishy network;
then, looking up, he suddenly fell to swearing
violently in a variety of Oriental languages. The
<i>Niagara</i> was just off under full headway. Two men,
probably Dunstan and Paulding, were waving their
handkerchiefs from the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy stopped swearing as suddenly as he
had begun and burst into a roar of laughter; then he
looked ruefully at his shirt.</p>

<p>The fisherwoman was occupied in punching the
child&#8217;s ribs and standing it on its head. It was
spouting water like the fountain of Trevi, and gurgling
out lusty screams that proved the efficacy of
the treatment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hawkins,&#8221; said Waddy, becoming conscious
that he had observed her name over her door
in his momentary <i>coup d&#8217;&#339;il</i> before he sprang into
the water; &#8220;Mrs. Hawkins, I am wet; you will have
to dry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so you are,&#8221; said the lady, &#8220;wet as a
swab. Sammy, you jest git up an&#8217; go in the shop,
an&#8217; don&#8217;t you be fallin&#8217; overboard ag&#8217;in an&#8217; botherin&#8217;
the gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>She accompanied this advice with a box on the
ear of the sobbing Sammy, which started Trevi
again.</p>

<p>Without much ceremony or disappearance into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
tiring-room, Mr. Waddy doffed his wet clothes and
donned the toggery of the widow&#8217;s eldest son. His
cigar-case, well filled with cheroots, had fortunately
escaped with his coat. He lighted his first, and sat
waiting patiently while Mrs. Hawkins displayed his
wet raiment before her cooking stove and turned
the articles judiciously to toast on either side. Let
us observe him as he sits.</p>

<p>He is rather young for a nabob. Many of the
nabobs are lymphatic and wheezy, as well as old,
and that without reference to the place of their nabobery,
whether Canton, Threadneedle, or Wall
Street. Mr. Waddy was none of these&mdash;he was
alert, athletic, and thirty-seven. It is a grand thing
to have had one&#8217;s full experience and having chased
all flying destinies through the bush, to have caught
one and hold it safely in the hand, while the catcher
is still young and strong enough to handle and tame
the captive. Mr. Waddy looked strong and active
enough to catch and tame anything. But some
things are tamed only with delicacy and tenderness.
Was he destitute of these? At this moment, there
was no exhibition of any trait beyond nonchalant
patience, such as men who have had to deal with
Asiatics or Spanish Americans, necessarily acquire.
As the last film of his smoke-puff exhales from his
lips, they close under the yellow-brown moustache
into an expression of firmness, and perhaps of pride.
It was easy to see that firm might become stern, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
pride might harshen bitterly, if treachery should
betray generosity and repel candour.</p>

<p>Tossing his cheroot-end into the stove, he allows
an interregnum for reverie. He leans his head upon
his hand; his thick brown hair half hides the keen
sparkle of his grey eyes; the lines of his mouth
soften. He is thinking probably of welcomes from
old friends, of pilgrimages to old shrines. Suddenly
he throws down his hand; the proud expression
closes again about his lips, his face hardens, hardens&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brown man, what makes you look so ugly and
black?&#8221; says Sammy, loquitur. &#8220;Ma, I know he
wants to kill me for wettin&#8217; his clothes,&#8221; and Sammy
wept boo! hoo!</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, my boy,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy, and putting
his hand into a pocket he thought his own, he
drew out not the expected purse containing the presentable
shilling, but a strip of pigtail tobacco.
&#8220;Am I brown? I am the Ancient Mariner. I have
been where the sun bakes men as brown as that loaf
of gingerbread. Here are two shillings out of my
vest pocket. Keep one yourself and buy that loaf
from your mother with the other. My mother used
to bake gingerbread and my father sold it, years ago,
when I was white, not ginger-coloured.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Ira and Sammy came to terms of peace and
good will and munched together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kind er guess your things is dry now, capting,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
said Mrs. Hawkins. &#8220;I&#8217;ll jest put the flatiron to
that air shirt and make it as slick as a slide. Salt
water don&#8217;t take sterch or them collars would stan&#8217;
right up.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Mr. Waddy was recovering his habiliments,
Isaiah Hawkins, the widow&#8217;s eldest son, came in.
He owned a small coaster and was to sail that afternoon
for Portland. He came to get his traps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you take a passenger?&#8221; inquired Mr.
Waddy, after the usual preliminary greetings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, capting,&#8221; replied Hawkins, with much
deliberation, &#8220;I dunno as I could, an&#8217; I dunno as I
couldn&#8217;t. What kind a feller is this ere passenger?
Kin he eat pork an&#8217; fish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the man,&#8221; explained Mr. Waddy. &#8220;I
should think I could eat pork and fish. I&#8217;ve lived
in Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, capting, come along if yer like,&#8221; said
Hawkins heartily, &#8220;an&#8217; it shan&#8217;t cost yer a durned
cent. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t every feller I&#8217;d take, but I feel kinder
&#8217;bleeged to yer fer pickin&#8217; up Sam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy would not consent to be a dead-head,
but took pay passage at once, to start at two. Meanwhile
he strolled about the town, and climbing the
steep glacis, admired the glorious bay and the impregnable
fort. He was entering when his way
was stopped by the sentinel.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one admitted without special order,&#8221; announced
that functionary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>&#8220;My old friend Mr. Waddy has special entr&eacute;e
everywhere!&#8221; cried a passing officer, laying his hand
on Ira&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;My dear fellow, you wouldn&#8217;t
let me thank you at Inkerman for dropping that
Cossack. Now I intend to pepper you with gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! we never mention it, Granby,&#8221; retorted
Ira, warmly grasping the extended hand,
&#8220;unless you need reminding how you dropped the
rhinoceros who wouldn&#8217;t drop me. By the way,
I&#8217;ve had a match-box made of his horn.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled out his cigar-case and the match-box.
They each took a cigar and walked off together to
Major Granby&#8217;s quarters, as coolly as if the reciprocal
life-saving they had recalled was an everyday business.</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the name of Mercury came you here?&#8221;
asked the major, after they were seated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger beer&mdash;gingerbread, beer,&#8221; murmured
Waddy abstractedly. &#8220;Bass&#8217; Pale Ale. Yes&mdash;ah,
well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, ho! Patrick!&#8221; called the major. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
Mr. Waddy come back and wants his ale!&#8221;</p>

<p>While Patrick grinned a cheerful recognition and
drew the cork, Mr. Waddy explained his position
and the gingerbread allusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sail at two for Portland in the <i>Billy Blue
Nose</i>,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you come and
see me in the States?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>&#8220;Why not? I&#8217;ll join you when you please,&#8221; assented
Granby instantly. &#8220;I already have a furlough.
I wish I could start to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come by the next steamer, to-day fortnight,&#8221;
suggested Ira, &#8220;and meet me in Boston at the Tremont
House. I&#8217;m really as much a stranger as
you; but they all know me. We&#8217;ll see the lions
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be a ladies&#8217; man, for my sake,&#8221;
said the major. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard the American women
are the loveliest of the world, and I&#8217;ve determined
to see for myself. I thought, before I saw you, of
dropping in at Newport this summer. That&#8217;s the mart,
I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, we&#8217;ll go there and everywhere,&#8221;
agreed Ira. &#8220;What do you say to a partnership
for matrimonial speculation? You put in good
looks, good name, and glory. I contribute money&mdash;the
prize, of course, to be mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say nothing about wit,&#8221; the major pointed
out. &#8220;Modest! As to good looks, these are perhaps
degenerate days, but you&#8217;ll do very well for an
Antinous with whiskers, and I used constantly in
Rome to be mistaken for the Apollo, in costume of
the period.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Apollo, I leave you to study attitudes,&#8221;
said Waddy, rising. &#8220;I must be off. Good-bye!
To-day three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long! Here, Pat! pack up a carpet-bag for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Mr. Waddy and put in some of those short shirts.
My six-feet-one beats you by three inches.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Billy Blue Nose</i> was quite ready. Mr.
Waddy was also ready and just stepping into the
boat when he heard Sammy&#8217;s voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, mister! gimme another shilling to buy
gingerbread!&#8221;</p>

<p>We leave the reader to judge whether the prayer
went unanswered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<span class="small">A GENTLE LADY OF FORTUNE DECIDES TO FACE A<br />
STORM</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE afternoon was hot and sulky. Still, as the
party had fixed that day for leaving The
Island, they would not change their plan. Old
Dempster said there would certainly be &#8220;considerable
of a blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the party had longed for a storm; the young
ladies had rhapsodised about billows and breakers
and driving spray and heroic encounters with warring
elements. Now that the long roll of premonitory
surges was crashing in sullenly on Black Rock
Head and Wrecker&#8217;s Point, they seemed to shrink a
little from billows unsunlit. Grandeur was too much
for them. To recline on the rocks under a parasol
held by a gentle cavalier, this was gay and dressy
and afforded the recumbent and her attendant knight
indefinite possibilities. But ladies are not lovely
in submarine armour, and muslins limply collapse
when salt showers come whirling in from shattered
waves. The great wild terror of the certain storm
made itself felt among the gay party. They were
quite willing to hasten their departure and pass the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
night quietly at Loggerly. They would spend also
a quiet next day there and take the train on the
second morning for Portland and Boston.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan preferred to stay for the promised
entertainment. She seemed already a little excited
out of her usual tranquil reserve by the thought that
Nature was to act a wild drama for her benefit. Besides,
apart from the storm, she was willing to pass
one solitary day on the rocks and along the beach.
She also longed for one last master-view from the
mountain above Dempster&#8217;s house. She was glad
to see all these without the intrusion of gaiety. It
may have been a mood; it may have been character.
She would visit, for perpetual recollection, the best
spots undisturbed; a storm would be clear gain.
Mr. Dempster promised to drive her over to Loggerly
next evening, rain or shine.</p>

<p><i>Au revoir!</i> and they were off, some walking, some
already mounted into the great farm wagon. They
had a very lively time through the delicate birch
woods. Miss Julia Wilkes was quite sure she had
seen a deer. Blooming lips were brighter for the
strawberries they crushed; rosy fingers rosier for
plucking the same. When they reached the open
country and were all seated in the wagon, taking the
down-hills at a gallop, and the up-hills at an impetus,
Julia turned to her mother, that excellent,
gossipy person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Sullivan has a strange fancy,&#8221; said she,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
&#8220;to wander about alone in wild places. Did you
notice how almost handsome she was to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in the <i>fortis Gyas</i> Cutus; &#8220;she
looked like a cheerful Banshee, inspired at the
thought of a storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Sullivan was nobly handsome once,&#8221; said
Mrs. Wilkes, &#8220;and will be soon again, I hope, now
that she is rich and done with all family troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she very rich?&#8221; asked Cloanthus Fortisque,
friend of Gyas. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m so much afraid of
her. She may be sweet as ice-cream, but she is
colder. A feller couldn&#8217;t sail in with much chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Julia pouted a little at this ingenuous remark
of Fortisque and devoted herself to Gyas
Cutus for the rest of the journey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was lonely at Dempster&#8217;s when the gay party
was gone. The house looked singularly small and
mean. Mrs. Dempster was baking wondrous bread;
bread for which all the visitors had gone away
bulkier. Miss Miranda Dempster was up to her
elbows in strawberries. She was a magnificent
lioness of a woman, with a tawny mane of redundant
locks.</p>

<p>The kitchen was close and the hot, heavy atmosphere
affected Miss Sullivan&#8217;s views as to the quality
of her hostess&#8217;s bread. She walked out upon the
little meadow, a bit of tender culture between the
forest and the rude and rocky shore. Old Dempster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
and Daniel, his son, were hurrying their hay into the
ox-cart. The oxen seemed to stand unnecessarily
knockkneed and feeble in the blasting heat. Yet
the sun was obscured and there came puffs of breeze
from seaward. But these were puffs explosive,
sultry, volcanic, depressing.</p>

<p>As Miss Sullivan approached, Dempster was tossing
up an enormous mass of hay to Daniel. A puff
of wind caught it and one half &#8220;diffused to empty
air,&#8221; making air no longer empty but misty with
hay-seed, and aromatic with mild fragrance.
Dempster shook himself and stood leaning on his
pitchfork. He was a grand old yeoman, worthy to
be the father of heroes. The Island, though not a
solitary one, had been to him a Juan Fernandez. He
was a contriver of all contrivances, a builder of all
that may be built. He farmed, he milled, he fished,
he navigated in shapely vessels of his own shaping;
his roof-tree was a tree of his own woods, felled
and cleft by himself. He had split his own shingles
as easily as other men mend a toothpick; with these
he had tented his roof-tree over. Miss Sullivan and
he were great friends, and now, as she drew near,
he looked at her with kindly eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Miss Sullivan,&#8221; said he, &#8220;them oxen has
stopped chewin&#8217; the cud&mdash;another sure sign of a
storm. The wind is sou&#8217;west. It&#8217;ll be short, but
hot an&#8217; heavy&mdash;a kind er horriken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the storm is severe, what will all these fishing-vessels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
do?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I have counted nearly
a hundred this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most on &#8217;em will go birds&#8217;-nestin&#8217; &#8217;round in the
bays an&#8217; coves along shore. Some on &#8217;em alluz gits
caught, an&#8217; that&#8217;s what makes me feel kind er
anxious now. You see, my boy Willum has been
buyin&#8217; a schooner up to New Brunswick, with a
pardner of his, and he&#8217;s jest as like as not to be
takin&#8217; her down to Boston about now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not!&#8221; cried Miss Sullivan, shuddering
involuntarily in the hot chill of another isolated
blast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, worryin&#8217; won&#8217;t mend nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said the
father, with stoic calmness. &#8220;Come, Dan&#8217;l, we must
hurry up with this &#8217;ere hay,&#8221; and the two fell to
work again; but the face of the elder man was very
grave as he glanced, from time to time, at the grey
sky and sullen sea.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan strolled on across the meadow to
Black Rock Head. There she had often sat in brilliant
days and sent her looks and thoughts a-dreaming
beyond the misty edge of the ocean world. To-day
a strange, dismal heaviness in the air made
dreams nightmares. Perpetual calm seemed destined
to dwell upon the ocean, so unruffled was its
surface and unsuggestive of storms to be. Looking
down from the Head, Miss Sullivan would scarcely
have discerned the great, slow surges, lifting and
falling monotonously. They made themselves felt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
however, when they met the opponent crag. A vast
chasm stood open in its purple rocks, and as the lazy
waves fell upon the unyielding shore, they flowed in,
filling this cavernous gulf almost to the brim with
foaming masses. Then, as the surge deliberately
withdrew, these ambitious waters, abandoned and
unsupported, plunged downward in a wild whirlpooling
panic, stream overwhelming stream, all
seething together furiously, hissing, roaring,
thundering, until again they met the incoming
breaker, and again essayed as vainly to rise above
control and overcome the enduring land.</p>

<p>Mists, slowly uprising, had given sunset a dull
reception, and the great southeastern cloud-bank was
growing fast heavier and heavier. Puffs of driving
fog began to hide the mountain and lower down
upon the Dempster house. Darkness fell, and at
last Miss Sullivan was driven in.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<span class="small">A WRECK AND A RESCUE</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALL night the storm did its tyrannous work over
sea and land; all night, around old Dempster&#8217;s
house, it howled its direful menaces. But the house
stood firm, for it had been built to withstand the
shock of any storm; only shivered now and then as
the gale smote it with heavier hand, then tore on its
way lamenting.</p>

<p>More than once Miss Sullivan awoke and lay
listening to the storm&#8217;s wild voices&mdash;voices which
recalled the past&mdash;voices whispering, pleading, sighing,
moaning to be heard again and again answered.
And they were answered&mdash;answered with bitter
moans and tears, and at last with prayers for patience
and peace, and, if need were, for pardon.</p>

<p>Neither Mrs. Dempster nor Miranda understood
the enthusiasm of Miss Sullivan for storms and
breakers. There were several things they would
rather do than venture out next morning: the chief
of which was to stay at home.</p>

<p>Old Dempster looked uneasily at the cloud-drift.
The wind was as furious as ever, but the rain came
only in keen showers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>&#8220;These &#8217;ere sou&#8217;-easters,&#8221; said he, &#8220;never last
long at this time o&#8217; the year. It&#8217;ll be clear as moonshine
by long about noon. But ef you&#8217;ve got your
mind set on goin&#8217; out, I&#8217;ll rig you out so you&#8217;ll be
dry as a rooster. Dan&#8217;l, go down to the mill an&#8217;
bring up them short overhauls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan&#8217;l brought up a great coat of yellow, oiled
canvas, and a tarpaulin with a flap like the tail of a
Barbary sheep. Mrs. Dempster supplied a pair of
Dan&#8217;l&#8217;s fishing boots, outgrown by him in one bare-footed
summer, but still impervious.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan, a person very critical in her toilet,
hesitated a little at this unaccustomed attire. However,
it was the sensible style. Miranda aided her
in encasing herself. Stiffish were both overhauls
and boots; stiffness itself, at the first interview.</p>

<p>When they returned to the kitchen to stand inspection,
a sound was heard as if the kettle of dried
apples boiling on the stove had suddenly bubbled
and sputtered over. It was Dan&#8217;l, utterly unable to
control his laughter. He immediately disappeared,
and was heard in the wood-shed endeavouring to
whistle, but constantly breaking down into a
snicker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Dan&#8217;l!&#8221; said Miss Sullivan; &#8220;I must look
very droll, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; said Mrs. Dempster, &#8220;you are kind er
like my idee of a Mormon&mdash;I mean one o&#8217; them
folks in the pictures with gals&#8217; heads an&#8217; more like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
a codfish to the other end. Now if one o&#8217; them gals
should make herself decent with a set of overhauls&mdash;an&#8217;
massy knows she wants suthin&#8217; to cover her&mdash;she&#8217;d
look jest as pooty as you do. Wouldn&#8217;t
she, old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>To avoid other comparisons as complimentary to
mermen or maids, Miss Sullivan ran from her circle
of amused admirers and, passing among the pathless
cucumber vines of the little garden, began awkwardly
to climb the fence that kept any amphibious
rodent monster of the deep from predatory excursions
among the radishes and hollyhocks. Beyond
the garden, a thicket of wild fruit vines nearly
closed the shoreward path. Drops of rain hung
heavy, crushing the bushes with pearly wreaths.
A few raspberries were only waiting one sunny day
to take their dull purple crimson of ripeness. It
was wet work to penetrate by the obliterated path.
Miss Sullivan, however, crowded steadily forward.</p>

<p>When the rustling of her passage through the
thicket ceased, she could hear the neighbour crashing
of breakers. Black Rock Head rose to the
north of the rocky cove, home of Dempster&#8217;s boat.
Southward stood other headlands, and southern-most,
Wrecker&#8217;s Point, where all the fury of surges
driven by the southeast gale would be felt. When
the mingled mist, spray, and rain were drifted away
for a moment, and shrank to give space to a great,
howling blast, she could see a lofty white ghostly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
object, like a ship in full sail, dimly visible, suddenly
lift itself against the dark front of the Head.
Then it sank away, dashed to nothingness of foamy
wreck. A hollow roar came, as the cavernous cleft
of the Head was overcrowded with the breaker, and,
gushing up, the mass of uprising waters overwhelmed
the promontory and, spreading, mantled
over its smooth surfaces and tore in many cataracts
down its chasms to the sea. The Head, through
veils of mist, seemed like a distant dome mountain
of snow.</p>

<p>Black Rock Head was evidently unapproachable,
so Miss Sullivan faced the blast and its blinding,
driving spray, for a sheltered spot farther on toward
Wrecker&#8217;s Point. She found that her foreground
of vision of storm-experiences was crowding
itself with quite unsatisfactory detail. There
was no sieve of trees by the shore to filter the salt
showers. Sometimes there was but a narrow path
between slippery slopes of grass and rounded rocks
glistening with the touch of the more ambitious
breakers. As she passed by these perilous places, an
unlooked-for wash of water would come hungrily
up and hasten hungrily back, willing to sweep away
fragile womanhood. The morning was well advanced
when, with slow and difficult progress, the
lady who, after her bold vigour of devotion to her
object, merits, at least for the nonce, the title of our
heroine, reached Wrecker&#8217;s Point.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>Of seeing much that storms may do she had had
her heart&#8217;s desire. All the dread fury of maddened
winds had burst upon her till she had tottered back
to some shelter of intervening rock, appalled at
tempest terrors that houselings never know. In
tremulous pauses, when the gale was still, she had
heard the coming thunder of the long breaker, coming
awfully because an infinite ocean drove it on;
and as this went bursting like an upward avalanche
from crag to crag beyond, in the silence while the
next billow was lifting she had heard those dreadful
ocean voices surrounding her, a wild atmosphere
of remorse&mdash;of remorse unpardoned and forever
unpardonable for all the murderous wrongs of ocean
to the world. And after these came the bewildering
whirl of spray and rain, the crash, the hissing
fall, and then the great blow of the breaker like a
knell. It hammered at the world&#8217;s foundations,
until that solid world seemed an unstable thing to
tread.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased when Miss Sullivan reached
the Point. It was clearing, and she could look more
widely over the immense agitation and sway of
the lurid sea. She sat for an hour or wandered
about over perils of wave-worn crags, that waves
were now striving vainly to shatter. At last she
remembered that she had the beach still to visit
before her return. Her path thither was through
a wood, tangled and bewildering with vines and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
underbrush. The storm was now almost a calm,
but the thunder of the surges followed her as she
hastened along the dripping trail. Penetrating
slowly through the wood by paths of uneasy footing,
she began to distinguish the distant part of the
beach. It formed one end of a parallelogram,
whose sides were dark ranges of low, broken precipice
and the farther end the blank of sea. Opposite
her, the precipice continued up into a wooded
mountain. The sun was just breaking forth and
scattering a slender, illumined scarf of mist, that
wavered in among the trees of the mountain-side,
and melted into that ever-fresh wonder of beauty,
the calm sky of summer.</p>

<p>There was much rubbish strewn along the beach.
Miss Sullivan could see old waterlogged slabs, logs
purple with long drowning, pieces of spar, a plank
or so. As she descended and looked over the nearer
sands, she saw more rubbish; more than usual, perhaps
of a recent wreck. Such a storm could hardly
pass without touching the pockets of jolly underwriters&mdash;less
jolly over their noon sandwich as the
telegraph told of ships ashore.</p>

<p>The path began to skirt the edge of the broken
cliff, and finally descended rapidly, by a series of
dangerous stepping places, toward the level. It
was quite evident there had been a wreck. The
water deepened very slowly out from the shore, and
each swell, as it swept in, drove along bits or masses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of wreckage, and retiring, dragged them back, to be
again heaved farther up.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan had never before seen a wreck.
She suddenly seemed very curious to examine this
one nearer,&mdash;passionately curious, indeed,&mdash;and began
to leap down the hillside rather precipitately.
However, she was now used to Dan&#8217;l&#8217;s boots; otherwise
her headlong speed would have been dangerous.
She found it rather deep trudging in the
sand, deeper and more difficult as she ran rapidly
down after the returning waves; and she found it a
struggle for her own life in the undertow, as she
resolutely plunged forward and, grasping some
wrecked fragments, fought with so much desperate
womanish force as she had to drag them in to shore
and safety.</p>

<p>These fragments had lashed to them the body of
a man.</p>

<p>The sea had done with this object what it chose;
it was weary of its plaything, and now aided her in
her merciful task. For many moments she was
ready to despair and drown; but hope was her ally,
and a nervous, unsuspected strength, and at last she
gained a firm footing and dragged the man away
from the waves up on the wet sand.</p>

<p>She sank exhausted in a dizzy trance, blinded and
fainting. It had been a terrible, heart-rending
agony of combat&mdash;a very doubtful strife for two
lives with the hungry sea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>Starting up at last, she seemed to shrink from
quieter examination of the wrecked person. But
conquering fear or superstition in a moment&#8217;s
struggle, she knelt beside him. His arm was raised,
covering his face, and his clenched hand held something
that was attached by a strand of silk around
his neck. As she removed the arm, the hand relaxed
in hers and a small book fell from it; she pulled it
from the silk and laid it hastily by.</p>

<p>Parting the hair from the sadly bruised and battered
face, she looked vainly into closed eyes for any
light of life. She laid her hand where the heart
should be beating; she placed her lips close, nay,
almost touching, livid lips, to catch a faintest breath;
she did all those passionately desperate things that
one may do, feeling that another life may depend
on each lapsing moment&#8217;s effort. She had nothing
to cut the lashings which bound him to the wreck,
and tore at them furiously, vainly, with her teeth.
There was a hard, dry sobbing in her throat, and
her features worked convulsively as she paused, exhausted,
and gazed down at that white, quiet face.
She was ready again to despair. She could not
leave him; would no help come? The sun seemed
oppressively hot and cruel&mdash;a staring, insulting fullness
of daylight.</p>

<p>Help was coming. She heard a cheerful woman&#8217;s
voice singing a negro melody in the wood. Miranda
had evidently expected that Miss Sullivan&#8217;s circuit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
would bring her to the beach and had come to join
her.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan essayed to scream, but could not.
Miranda came to the bank, and seeing her standing
like a ghost, vainly striving to beckon, divined
the whole in an instant and sprang down the
steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he dead?&#8221; cried Miranda.</p>

<p>The formalising of a dreaded thought into words
makes its terrors doubly terrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead! I fear so,&#8221; said Miss Sullivan, very
slowly and with a shiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;He shan&#8217;t die if we can help it,&#8221; said Miranda
resolutely. &#8220;Here, Miss Mary, you run right up to
the second field. Up there, Uncle Jake&#8217;s out
with the boys, seeing if they can mow after the
shower. Bring &#8217;em down quick&mdash;I&#8217;ll cut him
loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suiting act to word, she whipped out a jagged
penknife of schoolmarm days from her pocket, and
began to saw at the lashings.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan clambered, panting, up the cliff
and plunged into the wood. Presently she appeared
at a run, followed by Uncle Jake and the two boys&mdash;biggish
boys of six feet two.</p>

<p>Miranda had cut the lashings of rotten stuff.
Uncle Jake supported the man in his arms. He was
perfectly insensible.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not dead,&#8221; said Uncle Jake.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;ll live; I know he&#8217;ll live!&#8221; cried Miranda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; shouted the two boys tumultuously&mdash;a
view-halloo for a found life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; said Miss Sullivan, with a quick,
irrepressible sob of thankfulness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<span class="small">IN WHICH MISS SULLIVAN FINDS MANY REASONS<br />
FOR DEPARTURE</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">UNCLE JAKE and his giant progeny made
light of their burden, all the half-mile to old
Dempster&#8217;s. They were confident, feeling their own
vigorous blood beating healthily from end to end of
their great bodies, that no man, not dead, could die.
In their experience as farmers and fishermen, they
had seen much more dangerous hurts recovered
from than any of the stranger&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s pretty well bunged up an&#8217; has swallered
an almighty lot o&#8217; salt water; but that&#8217;ll do him
good an&#8217; cure the bruises. Why, I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder,&#8221; continued Uncle Jake, gradually talking
himself into positiveness, &#8220;ef he was jumpin&#8217; &#8217;round
by day after to-morrer, as spry as a two-year-old.
He ain&#8217;t a sailor. I kind er guess he was a passenger
aboard some &#8217;long-shore craft. That wrecked
stuff looked like it belonged to some Down East
schooner. I hope it warn&#8217;t Bill Dempster&#8217;s. Now,
Mirandy, you take good keer o&#8217; this here chap an&#8217;
p&#8217;r&#8217;aps he&#8217;ll be a-buckin&#8217; up to yer, when he&#8217;s so&#8217;s to
be &#8217;round.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>Miranda and Miss Sullivan smiled. Uncle Jake
was evidently a little more concerned than he pretended,
and chatted to keep up their spirits. Once
or twice when the bearers paused to shift hands or
rest a moment, their burden seemed to make a futile
attempt toward life. There was a tremor of eyelid
and lip&mdash;perhaps a slight unclosing of the eye.
Still, if there was any change, deathliness soon
came again.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan and Miranda ran on to make preparations.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;that we&#8217;d better put
him in your room, if you still mean to go, as you
decided yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; replied the other, with a quick intaking
of the breath, &#8220;unless I can be of some service
to this gentleman.&#8221; Was it her fine instinct
that had recognised the gentleman?</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what you can do more than mother
and I will&mdash;except that you have kinder, pleasanter
ways,&#8221; Miranda assured her. &#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps this man
will turn out to be a sailor &#8217;long shore, after all, and
we&#8217;ll know how to nuss him better than you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Miss Sullivan, &#8220;we shall see;&#8221; but
it was evident that in her heart she was quite certain
he was no sailor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dempster flurried about and had everything
ready in the invalid&#8217;s room by the time Uncle Jake
arrived. The three men carried their burden into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
his hospital, while the women waited anxiously for
a report. Life or Death?</p>

<p>Old Dempster and Dan&#8217;l at this moment returned
from catching and feeding White Socks and
preparing the buggy for Miss Sullivan&#8217;s journey.
While they were hearing the history of the rescue,
Uncle Jake came out with a cheerful look.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t no sailor,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Here&#8217;s his
pocket-book with three hundred an&#8217; fifty dollars in
gold. You just take that, old woman, and don&#8217;t let
Dan&#8217;l use any on &#8217;em for buttons to his new swaller-tail.
Wal, Miss Sullivan, I guess your man&#8217;ll git
well. He&#8217;s breathin&#8217; reg&#8217;lar, but don&#8217;t seem to
know nothin&#8217; yit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miranda went to take her place as nurse by the
bedside. By-and-by, her mother needing her for a
few moments, she called Miss Sullivan.</p>

<p>The wrecked man was beginning to stir about uneasily.
He murmured and muttered names, evidently
those uppermost in his waking thought. Life
was struggling to regain voluntary control. He was
feverish. Miss Sullivan gave him from time to time
spoonfuls of stimulant; his weakness and exhaustion
needed this. It was a new position for her, and she
managed rather awkwardly,&mdash;more awkwardly than
one would have expected who knew her usual deftness.
Once, when his eyes again half opened, she
shrank away, and when he again became delirious
and rejected his restorative and went on speaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
wildly and incoherently, mingling names, words of
hate and words of love and words of dreary despair,
she burst into a sudden passion of excited tears and
called Miranda to come immediately and relieve her.
She evidently was not fit to be a calm nurse to the
stranger: a fact sufficiently curious, since her temperament
was quite the nursely one. But perhaps
she was too much concerned for her prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</p>

<p>The afternoon hastened away. The sufferer
seemed momentarily improving. He had now fallen
into a quiet sleep. Mr. Dempster appeared to ask the
plans of his guest&mdash;to go or not to go?</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan said she felt that she could be of no
real service; she was, of course, much interested in
the final recovery of her waif, but she could have
news of him from Miranda; she ought not to detain
her friends at Loggerly.</p>

<p>What she did not say, in spite of a somewhat evident
anxiety to find reasons for departure, was that
she did not dare trust herself to encounter the
stranger on his recovery, so shaken was she by certain
inward tremors, so prostrated in strength and
spirits&mdash;the result, no doubt, of her efforts in his
behalf. An instinct of self-protection urged to
flight. She gave the word, &#8220;Go.&#8221;</p>

<p>White Socks and the buggy came to the door.
Dan&#8217;l stepped forward with a bunch of hollyhocks,
pink, yellow, and purple. He got a very unexpected
kiss&mdash;unexpected by giver and receiver.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>&#8220;Thank you for your boots, Dan&#8217;l. I could not
have gone a step without them.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a very blushing Dan&#8217;l, a very pensive
Dan&#8217;l, a very manly Dan&#8217;l, a very like-a-first-lover
Dan&#8217;l, about the premises that evening. He doubled
his fists and said &#8220;Durn it!&#8221; very often, but always
ended with a pleased smile. Dan&#8217;l was having his
first glimpses into fairyland; his world seemed enchanted,
as he wandered out through the ferns to
sunset&mdash;strawberries his pretence.</p>

<p>Everyone was sorry to part with Miss Sullivan.
With Miranda especially, her adieux were most
affectionate. These two had been engaged in the
romantic duty of saving a life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Write me every day, Miranda,&#8221; were Miss Sullivan&#8217;s
last words, and she quite blushed as she uttered
them. &#8220;Write me every day and tell me how
he does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Dempster drove her away in the delicious
summer evening. White Socks made good play and
brought them into Loggerly at late twilight.</p>

<p>All the party greeted Miss Sullivan cordially and
gaily asked her experiences of storm life. She did
not dwell upon her share in the rescue&mdash;some occult
influence seemed to hold her back from speaking
of it&mdash;and soon retired. Extreme fatigue saved
her from the excitement of dreams, and she sank
into the blessedness of a sleep undisturbed by storminess
either from within or without. Sleep and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
change of scene will draw a blank between her and
the adventures of to-day: but she will hardly forget
them. Mad storms by the maddened sea are not
daily events in the lives of quiet ladies of fortune;
nor does it happen to every promenader by a beach
to be the point of safety whither a returning wanderer
may drift away from his death.</p>

<p>After Miss Sullivan&#8217;s disappearance, her companions
all talked of her, as people always do of the
dear departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odd idea, that of hers&mdash;to go out in the wet,&#8221;
observed Gyas. &#8220;How would you and I look, old
Clo, taking a picturesque ducking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did anyone ever see you doing anything picturesque,
Mr. Cutus?&#8221; inquired Miss Julia innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pictures are done of him&mdash;lots of &#8217;em by
Scalper,&#8221; said Cloanthus. &#8220;Scalper says his name
describes him exactly&mdash;he&#8217;s the best guy he can
find. There&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t have told that, Gyas, if
you hadn&#8217;t called me old Clo. You know I don&#8217;t
like nicknames.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder Miss Sullivan never married,&#8221; remarked
someone, to end this controversy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Sullivan has not been rich very long,&#8221; said
Mrs. Wilkes, in a tone to indicate that no further
explanation was needed; &#8220;only since the death of
her step-father. He had some property in Chicago
which suddenly became of enormous value. He left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
everything to her. You know her own family were
great people once, but lost caste and wealth by a
transaction of her father&#8217;s. After that, she was
obliged to teach in a public school for a while. Then
she became governess to Clara Waddie and Diana,
Mr. Waddie&#8217;s ward. When they went to Europe,
she came to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; said Julia, with ardency. &#8220;I was an immense
little fool, till then. But, mamma, wasn&#8217;t
there a story of a love affair of hers, while she was
young?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Horace Belden hinted something of the kind,&#8221;
replied her mother, &#8220;and that he was the object.
But he is very willing to claim conquests. As soon
as the news of her great inheritance came, while she
was with us in Paris, Mr. Belden called upon her.
He pretended great surprise that she was our governess
and regret that he had not seen his old friend
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew it, I&#8217;m sure he did!&#8221; cried Julia.
&#8220;Miss Sullivan and I met him twice in the Louvre,
and both times he dodged&mdash;palpably. I could not
understand why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Mrs. Wilkes, serenely picking
up her story where she had been interrupted,
&#8220;with the news of the fortune came Mr. Belden.
Miss Sullivan was in the salon with me. He went
up to her with that soft manner which he thinks
so irresistible. &#8216;My dear Miss Mary,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
had no idea that you were here with my friends.
Permit me to be among the first to congratulate you.
It seems that the Fates do not always err in distributing
their good gifts. How long it is since we
have met! Where have you been this age?&#8217; Mary
received him rather icily; and afterwards she would
never speak of him, except to say that they were
neighbours in childhood. I suspect that it was
merely his slights during her poverty that displeased
her&mdash;I don&#8217;t believe she was ever in love
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was not that the time when he was so attentive
to Diana?&#8221; asked Julia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear,&#8221; babbled the good, gossipy Mrs.
Wilkes, &#8220;and she liked him, as d&eacute;butantes are
very apt to like men of the world; but Clara Waddie
and Diana and Miss Sullivan were always together,
and whenever Mr. Belden went, he found his &#8216;old
friend&#8217; cool and distant as possible. I don&#8217;t think
Mary ever spoke of him to Diana, but there came
a sudden end of sentimental t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes such as
they had had in Switzerland, and when he proposed
to Diana to go off and look at some picture,
or point of view, she always made it a condition to
invite Miss Sullivan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, these duennas!&#8221; said the brave Gyas, who
had frequently found his bravery of heart and toilet
to become naught in their presence. &#8220;But who is
this Diana? Is her other name Moonshine? I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
everybody and don&#8217;t know her. Where did you
pick her up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pick her up!&#8221; exclaimed Julia, in wrath.
&#8220;Diana! Why, she would hardly touch anyone
with her parasol, except for friendship&#8217;s sake&mdash;and
she&#8217;s the dearest girl! You&#8217;ll see her this summer,
but she won&#8217;t let you talk to her, because you are
not agreeable enough,&#8221; and Miss Julia blushed a
little the next moment and was sorry for her wrath
at the brave Gyas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she rich?&#8221; asked the prudent Cloanthus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; she is very rich. She owns Texas,&#8221;
replied Julia confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Texas!&#8221; echoed Cloanthus, bewildered by the
spacious thought. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a state or a country,
or a part of Mexico, or something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is,&#8221; admitted Julia; &#8220;perhaps she
only owns half of it. But I am sure I&#8217;ve heard her
speak of riding for a day over her own land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilkes was now asleep in her chair&mdash;hence,
and hence only, her silence. She awoke suddenly
and reminded her friends of their early morning
start. They separated for the night.</p>

<p>Next day, when the conductor of the railroad
train came to Miss Sullivan for her fare, she transferred
her purse from her bag to the pocket of her
travelling dress. As she did so, she felt an unfamiliar
object. It proved to be the book she had
taken from the drowning man&#8217;s hand, and, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
thinking, dropped into her pocket. It had been protected
by a covering of oiled silk. The stitches in
drying had given way and the book was slipping
out. She thought there could be no harm in her
opening it.</p>

<p>It was an old, well-worn Testament. On the title-page
was the inscription &#8220;M. Janeway to I.
Waddy.&#8221; It was very touching to think of this
drowning man clinging to the last to this emblem
of his religion, and perhaps token of an early love.
No doubt it was in sympathy with some such
thought as this that Miss Sullivan&#8217;s hands began
suddenly to tremble, and her eyes to fill with tears
as she turned over the sacred pages.</p>

<p>The book opened naturally in her hand at a familiar
passage; she read a few lines; then the hot
tears blinded her and she put the book hastily away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<span class="small">A PEPPERY INVALID WHO DREAMS DREAMS AND<br />
BRINGS BAD NEWS</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the morning Mr. Waddy awaked, and, looking
feebly around, discovered Mrs. Dempster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the other?&#8221; he asked, half rising and
falling back disappointed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dempster called her daughter.</p>

<p>Miranda came, splendidly fresh from her morning&#8217;s
duties in full air, and her tawny locks shaken
about in dishevelled luxuriance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not you,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy, shrinking a little
from her lioness aspect. &#8220;I want the other. She
had a tarpaulin and yellow canvas clothes the first
time, and then I saw her again here&mdash;I am sure it
was here. Here! Where am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and looked about him wildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re in my house,&#8221; responded Mrs.
Dempster soothingly, &#8220;an&#8217; I hope you&#8217;ll make
yerself to hum. You&#8217;ve been drownded an&#8217; that
was Miss Sullivan that found you. Ef she hadn&#8217;t
been kind er cur&#8217;us about goin&#8217; out to see
how a storm feels, massy knows where you&#8217;d be
now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>&#8220;Miss Sullivan?&#8221; repeated Mr. Waddy. &#8220;There
is no one of that name who would take any trouble
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did take a sight er trouble, though,&#8221;
said the old lady, &#8220;an&#8217; some folks&#8217;d be more thankful
for &#8217;t than you seem to be. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t every city
lady that&#8217;ll go wadin&#8217; &#8217;round an&#8217; resk drownin&#8217;
herself to haul out a man. Some of them other
gals would &#8217;a&#8217; sat down an&#8217; screamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy, with weak testiness,
&#8220;I am not acquainted with Miss Sullivan and
did not ask her to save me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, now!&#8221; said Mrs. Dempster to herself.
&#8220;Sakes alive! What an ongrateful critter! I can&#8217;t
stan&#8217; it; but I s&#8217;pose he&#8217;s sick and onreasonible.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying she marched out, and clattering pans
soon banged a warlike accompaniment to her murmured
wrath.</p>

<p>Miranda remained, and Mr. Waddy turned to
her in a despairing search for information.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure that person in the tarpaulin was
Miss Sullivan?&#8221; he questioned. &#8220;Sullivan, I think
you said?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miranda nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite certain,&#8221; she assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; murmured Waddy, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a ghost.
I&#8217;m insane. I always wished to know what the feeling
was. Now I have it. Bring a strait-jacket,
quick! I&#8217;m dangerous! Hold me!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>And he sank back, looking excessively feeble and
quite manageable.</p>

<p>Presently he seemed to revive a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Miranda,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;how do you
suppose I know your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you heard mother call me,&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I heard it in a dream, an exquisite
dream, such as may come to us insane men to
compensate us for losing our wakeful wits. My
dream was this: I thought that I was lying powerless
in the dominion of a wonderful delight&mdash;a delight
not strange, but seemingly familiar as a fulfilled
prophecy, whose fulfilment had been forever
a lingering certainty. I was lying, trammelled by a
willing motionlessness, in the loveliest glade of a
wood fresh as Paradise. And then my trance, so
content with its own happiness, was visited with happiness
inexpressibly greater. It seemed that a face,
well known, as to dreams of infancy a mother&#8217;s
sweet watchfulness may be,&mdash;that such a face, perhaps
my own life-long dream of pureness personified,
bent over me and seemed searching through my
closed eyes, into my very soul, for the imperishable
legends of my better life, written there beneath my
earliest and holiest vows. I heard a voice, such as
I may have dreamed the voice of an angel, and it
said, &#8216;Beautiful world of God! Why are we not
happy?&#8217; Then all the vision faded into dimness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
and someone like you, you in fact, came between me
and the angel, and the voice called you by your
name, &#8216;Miranda.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a very pretty dream,&#8221; said Miranda, as he
stopped, visibly exhausted, &#8220;and truer than most
dreams. When we were bringing you up from the
beach, we rested several times in the wood, and Miss
Sullivan, who seems to me like an angel, stooped
over you to see whether you were reviving at all.
I remember, too, that she said something like what
you heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Sullivan,&#8221; repeated Mr. Waddy, rather
crossly; &#8220;a very respectable young woman, I&#8217;ve
no doubt. But I don&#8217;t know her&mdash;well, I must have
been in a trance and seen old visions.&#8221;</p>

<p>He remained silent for some time, buried in
thought&mdash;not pleasant thought, to judge by his
countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Princess Miranda,&#8221; he resumed, at last, &#8220;what
may be the name of your realm? Where am I? Is
Duke Prospero without?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in father&#8217;s house on The Island in
Maine,&#8221; answered Miranda simply. &#8220;There&#8217;s
father, now, just come back from taking Miss Sullivan
to Loggerly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So she&#8217;s gone without stopping to see whether
I lived or died!&#8221; muttered Mr. Waddy. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
of it. Infernal bore! to have to thank her and pay
compliments to some namby-pamby plough-girl.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Let&#8217;s see what I can give her&mdash;a six-inch cameo&mdash;a
copy of Tennyson&#8217;s poems&mdash;an annuity of ten
bushels of tracts? She won&#8217;t like money&mdash;I know
these Yankee girls. This Miranda is another style.
By curry!&#8221; asseverated he rapturously, &#8220;she is as
grand as a lioness. Singularly like Hawkins&#8217;s partner
in the schooner. Ah, those poor fellows! Not
one of them left, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>His reverie was interrupted by the entry of old
Dempster, accompanied by his wife and Dan&#8217;l.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, sir,&#8221; began the former, with brisk heartiness,
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you doin&#8217; better. Here&#8217;s
some money we found in your belt&mdash;three hundred
an&#8217; fifty dollars. Count it, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the money,&#8221; said Waddy. &#8220;I
would give that and much more to have news of the
vessel I was wrecked in. Have you heard anything
about her? She was a Down East schooner named
the <i>Billy Blue Nose</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What might the name of her owner be?&#8221; asked
Mr. Dempster. &#8220;One of my boys has been buyin&#8217; a
schooner up to Halifax.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hawkins was the name; but he had a partner,
a very fine young fellow, who told me he lived on
this coast. He lashed me to the spar and stayed by
me till she struck. His name was Dempster&mdash;William Dempster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said the old man, very solemnly, after
a moment, &#8220;it&#8217;s our boy Willum. He is lost.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>For another moment they were silent, as men are
when fatal words have been spoken; then the women&#8217;s
sobs burst forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no time to cry&mdash;not fer us men, at
least,&#8221; added the father. &#8220;I&#8217;ve said my prayers,
mother, an&#8217; you kin pray while we&#8217;re gone. Dan&#8217;l,
you go down to Brother Jake&#8217;s an&#8217; tell him it was
Willum&#8217;s schooner that this man was in. He&#8217;d better
take the boys an&#8217; go along the rocks west o&#8217; the
beach. You come after me down to our P&#8217;int&mdash;no&mdash;you
go with Brother Jake&mdash;I want t&#8217; be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked away heavily, as one carrying a great
burden. He could have no hope, but that worst assurance
of death&mdash;the sight of death, of his son
lying crushed and drowned on the rocks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dempster went to the bed and, stooping over,
kissed Mr. Waddy softly. The poor fellow, weakened
by his hurts, struck to the heart by the sorrow
he had brought to this family, burst into tears. And
to mother and sister, also, came the agonising relief
of bitter tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy was left alone and, overwearied, he
slept. And while he slept, life was busy with his
frame, renewing it again, rebuilding all its shrines
of saintly images, and all its cells where lonely
thoughts dwelt sadly. When he awakes, his manfulness
will avail that he may again take up the
old burdens, which he had, in his dream, laid
down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>All that day the father searched along the shore,
seeking what he feared to find. He did not speak,
but all the while his heart was calling upon one
name; and there was no reply. He wandered along
the jagged rocks of the harsh, iron coast, little coves
and clefts interrupting his progress. Into every one
of these he must peer shrinkingly, seeing in each,
in a hasty vision of the mind, a form he knew,
caught in the sheltered shallows and swaying heavily
as the tide poured in over dyke of rock or strip of
shining sand. He swung himself from crag to
dangerous crag, recklessly&mdash;yet not recklessly, even
in spots of desperate peril, but saving strength and
untremulous vigour of hand and limb; for at any
moment there might be for him a burden to bear,
tenderly, lovingly, bitterly.</p>

<p>At times he would pause and look long and earnestly
out upon the sea. The glitter of summer sunshine
overspread its surface. Multitudes of brilliant
sails, crowded by distance, came and went, and
as they passed, he might imagine the cheery hail of
whence and whither, and the wish from each to each
of fortunate voyage. But his look did not rest on
them; he was studying each hither surge, as it
mounted and sank away&mdash;looking for something
that was never heaved up by any sunlit billow,
and that to see among the quick swoopings of seagulls
would have been to him a horror and a shuddering despair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>Father and brother and kinsmen sought the lost
in vain; while in vain the mother and the sister
prayed as they waited tearfully. But there was no
answer to their prayers, save that universal cruel
one, &#8220;Be patient! Yes, be patient!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<span class="small">MR. WADDY MUSES UPON FATE AND UNDERTAKES<br />
A COMMISSION</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE family were all tenderly kind to Mr.
Waddy, but he needed only repose. It was
very sad within the house next day. Mrs. Dempster
and Miranda made one or two attempts to talk
with their patient, but his connection with the wreck
was too close and too saddening. He brought their
loss too clearly before them. They took refuge,
cheerlessly, in household duties.</p>

<p>As the day advanced, Mr. Waddy was able to
move about, and finally, dressed in Dan&#8217;l&#8217;s clothes,
to walk slowly with many halts down towards the
rocks. Here he could sit with the breeze fresh upon
him and basking in the bright sun. It was a very
different heat to that dull, blasting one which had
for years been trying to bake out all the lively juices
of his system.</p>

<p>Cheroots were Mr. Waddy&#8217;s favourite smoking.
Of course he had none at present, after his wreck.
Was it for the want of these that, even through his
feebleness of a half-drowned man, his old impatience
began to manifest itself? He had fancied,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
perhaps, that years of absence would have changed
him from the hot, ardent, passionate, confident, and
confiding youth of three lustra before. Were not
fifteen years enough to stoicise and epicureanise him?
Could he not keep cool and take his luxurious opportunities
of a wealthy idler with passive content?
Why must the native air awaken again the old
thoughts and the old forgotten hopes? Forgotten!
Ah, Mr. Waddy! hopes touched with disappointment
may blacken into despairs, and pass into the
background of shadow, away from foregrounds of
sunshine in the heart, but there they must abide unfading.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy, sitting by the seaside on The Island,
was not merely impatient&mdash;an invalid may naturally
be so when convalescence has made farther advance
with his mind than his body&mdash;he was also very sad.
He could not avoid connecting himself with the terrible
disaster which had marked his coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just my luck!&#8221; said he to himself. &#8220;Why must
I come home without any object? As soon as I arrive
on this wretched continent, my passing at a
hundred yards is enough to knock one boy into the
water. Then I get myself left by the steamer, and to
shorten my delay, I take the <i>Billy Blue Nose</i> and I
become its Jonah. My vessel goes to wreck; my men
are drowned: I am put under obligations to some romantic
old maid, and then I have to make a whole
family miserable with fatal news. And I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
saved&mdash;for some good purpose I am willing to believe.
But for what? Have I any duties besides to
be a jolly bachelor and tell a boy or two, like that
young Dunstan and his friend, how to behave? I
believe I have not a relative in the world&mdash;save possibly
that Mr. Waddie of New York&mdash;descendant,
perhaps, of my Tory ancestor&mdash;who wrote me from
Paris. It is rather pleasant to think of one relative,
and then Dunstan told me that the old boy had an
only child, a lovely daughter. Possibly she may be
a cousin within the kissing removes. Ah, pleasanter
still!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy was growing steadily more cheerful;
then he fell a long time drowsily silent&mdash;dreaming
undefined dreams&mdash;gazing out across the sea to the
horizon, where wavering warmth of air mingled
with quivering waves. But at last a chill in the air
reminded him that he was still an invalid, and that
evening was at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go in,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and get ready for my
start to-morrow. Dan&#8217;l must be persuaded to cede
his clothes to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went slowly back along the bushy path, pausing
now and then to pluck a raspberry, until he came
to the kitchen. He hesitated a moment, then went
in. Everything was as before&mdash;the old clock ticking
hours of a bitter day just as regularly to their
end as it had marked hours of happy holidays, or
of careful common days; the kettle of dried apples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
sputtering on the stove; the hot loaf ready for supper;
Dan&#8217;l depositing the evening&#8217;s milk on the
dresser. But by the stove sat old Dempster, now
doubly aged, stooping forward, his face covered
with both his hands. Waddy hesitated about intruding
his questions of business into the old man&#8217;s
grief. However, he looked up more cheerily than
Ira expected, and giving him a broad gripe of the
hand, asked of his health very cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so well,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy, &#8220;that I hope
to save you the trouble of keeping me longer than
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make yourself to home,&#8221; said Dempster.
&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to stay as long as you like.
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t in one day a man gits over bein&#8217; wrecked.
Besides, I kind er like to have someone &#8217;round; it
keeps the women folks from thinkin&#8217; of their
troubles. But if you&#8217;d oughter go, Jake &#8217;ll drive
you over to-morrow, over to Loggerly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ira, &#8220;I think I must go. Is there
anything I can do for you in Portland or Boston?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I guess I&#8217;ll ask one thing; &#8217;tain&#8217;t much, an&#8217;
you said my boy looked arter you a little, &#8217;fore the
schooner struck. There&#8217;s a spot down on the sheltered
side of Black Rock Head, jest to the end o&#8217;
my meader, where I allers calkerlated to be buried,
some day or other, along with the old woman. I
can&#8217;t find my boy to bury him there,&#8221; he added
simply, &#8220;but I&#8217;d like to put up somethin&#8217; of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
moniment t&#8217; make us think of him. These gravestone
pedlars don&#8217;t come very often to The Island;
they tried it fer several years, but folks seemed t&#8217;
give up dyin&#8217; and they didn&#8217;t git no orders. Wal,
I wish when you git to Boston, you&#8217;d look &#8217;round an&#8217;
buy me a handsome pair o&#8217; stones, a big one with a
round top fer the head, an&#8217; a small one fer the feet,
an&#8217; have Willum&#8217;s name an&#8217; age put on&mdash;I&#8217;ll write
it down an&#8217; Mirandy &#8217;ll look up a text. Have &#8217;em
leave room enough below Willum&#8217;s for another
name. When dyin&#8217; once gits into a family, there&#8217;s
no knowing where it &#8217;ll stop. I feel as if there&#8217;d be
some more on us goin&#8217; afore long. They kin ship
the stones in some of these coasters an&#8217; I&#8217;ll pay fer
&#8217;em down to the custom house. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t askin&#8217; too
much, I hope, mister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said Ira, much affected and resolving
that there should be no bill at the custom
house. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see that it is done just as you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanky kindly,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;When the
stones come along, I&#8217;ll set &#8217;em under the cedars.
It&#8217;ll do mother an&#8217; me a sight o&#8217; good to see &#8217;em an&#8217;
kind er make our boy seem near.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I wish to speak to you
about,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy, after a considerable silence.
&#8220;This Miss Sullivan&mdash;I have money enough
and to spare. Do you know of anything I could do
for her?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was put rather awkwardly; Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Waddy knew as well as anyone that money is not the
current coin to repay an act of devotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; said Dempster, seeing the good feeling
that suggested and checked the inquiry, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe she wants fer money. She offered me a
thousand dollars fer our P&#8217;int. I told her perhaps
I&#8217;d sell out the whole farm for two thousand. I&#8217;ve
been talkin&#8217; some, along back, with Willum, of goin&#8217;
out west an&#8217; settlin&#8217; by some o&#8217; them big lakes.
When folks has been used to water, they don&#8217;t like
to live away from it. Willum&#8217;s gone, but Dan&#8217;l&#8217;s a
handy boy, an&#8217; Mirandy&#8217;s as good as a whole
drawin&#8217; of some men. I guess we&#8217;ll go. It don&#8217;t
look quite so bright &#8217;round here as it did,&#8221; and he
passed his hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Miss Sullivan doesn&#8217;t buy it, I will,&#8221; said Ira
quickly. &#8220;Can you tell me where she is to be
found, so that I can have inquiry made what her
decision is? This is just the spot I should like to
buy&mdash;it is a good lonely place, where I can escape
from my friends,&mdash;if I ever make any,&#8221; he added,
in a half-voice and rather bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She came with a grist o&#8217; folks from York,&#8221; said
Dempster; &#8220;pretty good folks, but different kind to
her. Mirandy had their names on a paper, but it
got lost. But she said she&#8217;d write about the farm an&#8217;
I kin let you know. Wal, if you want to go in the
mornin&#8217; I must go over an&#8217; tell Jake. I&#8217;ll be gone
to the other field when you start; so good-bye.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>He gave Waddy a crushing grasp of the hand
and looked at him wistfully, as if he were recalling
his son through this one who had seen him last.
Then, feeling that tears&mdash;tears of that better manhood
which men call unmanly&mdash;were falling over
his brown cheeks, now hollow with fatigue and
sleepless grief, he unclosed his hand with grave
gentleness and walked slowly away.</p>

<p>Looking after him, something brought back to
Waddy&#8217;s mind that sentence the old man had uttered
a little while before:</p>

<p>&#8220;When dying once gets into a family, there&#8217;s no
knowing where it will stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt dimly that he had listened to a prophecy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<span class="small">THE NABOB RE-ENTERS CIVILISATION</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was a lovely afternoon, two days after the
events narrated in the last chapter, when a shabby
stranger might have been seen slowly pacing the
pavement that leads from one of those gates where
a stream of ardent pilgrims disembogues into the
purlieus of the Athens of America; pacing with
reverent sloth up toward the Acropolis where, like
fanes of gods still alive and kicking, tower the
Boston State House, the Boston Anthen&aelig;um, and
nobler than all, behind granite propyl&aelig;a, the Boston
Tremont House.</p>

<p>I said a shabby stranger might have been seen;
he might, had anyone looked. But no one looks at
shabby strangers, a fact for which this one was
deeply grateful, for his name was Ira Waddy, and
he was encased in a suit of Dan&#8217;l&#8217;s clothes. He was
still gloomy after his wreck, indisposed for the hospitalities
of his commercial correspondents, not unwilling
to visit his old haunts, himself unknown.</p>

<p>His first point was of course Dullish Court, his
childhood&#8217;s home; but it had changed beyond his
recognition. Here, in place of the little shop, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the great Waddy Buildings, erected by his order
and already trebled in value. The income of this
unmortgaged property was of itself town house,
country house, horses, dinners, balls, fashion and
respect, the kingdoms of this world and another.
Dullish Court had enlarged its borders for better
perspective of these stupendous granite structures.
Boston thought them more important than Mont
Blanc, the Temple of Solomon, Karnac, or the
Coliseum, and ciceroned the unsuspecting stranger
thither.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, sir; what do you think of that, sir? We
are plain, sir; but we are solid, sir&mdash;solid, sir, as the
godlike Daniel said of us. All belong to one man.
Boston boy, sir&mdash;went away with nothing; now
worth millions!&#8221; and the liquid l&#8217;s of that luxurious
word dwelt upon the cicerone&#8217;s tongue most
Spanishly.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy looked at his buildings with satisfaction.
They were worth looking at. In them,
everything that may be hoisted was hoisted; whatever
may be stored was stored. Any man, from any
continent or any island, would find there his country&#8217;s
products.</p>

<p>In front of the buildings were still to be seen
sights familiar to Mr. Waddy&#8217;s childhood, in other
parts of the city. Here were girls pulling furtive
pillage from the cotton bale; others making free
with samples of everything from leaky boxes; others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
sounding molasses barrels with a pine taster and fattening
on the contents. Mr. Waddy remembered
his own childish days when a dripping molasses barrel
was to him riches beyond the dreams of avarice;
his days of growth, when as clerk, he became himself
a Cerberus of barrels; his days of higher dignity
when, Ira still, he, from his tall stool, was short with
suppliants; and one more period of promotion when
the inner counting-house acknowledged his services
essential, and when Horace Belden, the ornamental
junior partner, became his constant companion and
most intimate friend, trusted with unnumbered confidences
by the true and trustful Waddy. After
that, came India and exile.</p>

<p>The shabby stranger moved on at last, rather content
with his granite block, but regretting the old
shop of his humbler days. The city was wholly
changed. He recognised no building anywhere, but
a vista of green trees appearing up a narrow street,
he made for this. He came out upon the Common,
and a very pretty place he found it, warm with rich
shadows and all beflowered with gay little children.
Fifteen years before, Mr. Waddy had sometimes
done what may still, perhaps, be done by Boston
swains and maids. He remembered circuits of the
Common, transits of the Common, lingerings in the
Common, by bright sunsets of summer, in electric
evenings of frosty winters, when Boston eyes grow
to keener sparkles, and Boston cheeks gain ruddy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
bloom; walks twilighted, moonlighted, starlighted&mdash;lighted
beautifully with all-beaming lights of nature
and youth and hope.</p>

<p>As Mr. Waddy, forgetting dinner, was gazing
charmedly across the green slopes of this rus-in-urbal
scene, remembering&mdash;pleasantly, doubtless,
though his face did not look pleasant&mdash;his youthful
strolls there-along, he saw sitting near one of the
gates a miserable crouching figure, almost rolled
into a ball. By its side was a box of withered cigars,
and a placard, &#8220;Please buy something of this Chinaman.&#8221;
As Mr. Waddy looked abstractedly at him,
quite certain not to buy, he saw a man of dark complexion
approach the cringing figure, stare at him
for a moment, jerk him violently by the tail, and
then, with howls of joy chiming in melodiously with
the other&#8217;s howls of anguish, fall to embracing him
ecstatically.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy was much amused to recognise his
servant Chin Chin in the embracer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil are you doing with that chap?&#8221;
he demanded, walking up and employing the toe of
one of Dan&#8217;l&#8217;s boots gently to interfere with this
affecting scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi yah! All same! Boston fashion!&#8221; shouted
the delighted Chin Chin, recognising his master in
spite of his disguise. &#8220;S&#8217;pose &#8217;em drown. No! All
same. Dis my cussem&mdash;murder&#8217;s brudder&#8217;s sum.
Hi yah!&#8221; and he gave the cigar merchant another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
tug of the cue, another embrace, and a quantity of
guttural gibberish. After this spasm of kinsmanly
regard, he explained to Mr. Waddy that Dunstan
had taken care of his effects and deposited them with
a letter at the Tremont House, intrusting also him,
Chin Chin, to the landlord&#8217;s care.</p>

<p>Chin Chin, dressed in his neat uniform&mdash;Mr.
Waddy would not call it a livery&mdash;seemed a Nepaulese
ambassador, some Bung Jackadawr, on a
visit of state, and Mr. Waddy his rough interpreter
on savage shores. Some drygoods buyers at the
Tremont House door were disposed to grin as the
apparent Down East Yankee came up the steps, and
to hee-haw when the landlord, recognising Chin
Chin and the signature, asked the signer if he would
like a private parlour. They grinned and hee-hawed
no more when they caught sight of that name of
power.</p>

<p>Meantime, Ira had been provided with his apartment.
Chin Chin had arrayed him in a summer
costume, easy and elegant, and he was dining vigorously,
rejoiced to have someone near him again on
whom his impatient oaths in Loo Choo and kindred
dialects were not thrown away.</p>

<p>Of a large number of letters, he first opened Dunstan&#8217;s.
It was brief, merely informing him what
had been done with the luggage. Mr. Waddy
paused, however, over the closing sentences:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a short hiatus in my life before the political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
campaign fairly commences, and shall yawn
through it at Newport with Paulding. Why won&#8217;t
you drop in and see something of our world after
your long absence? You will be amused and perhaps
instructed in the new social discoveries. Your
relatives, the Waddies, have a house there, a capital
lounging place, and are expected back from Europe
soon to occupy it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We made little Budlong rather unhappy for
leaving you. Chin Chin shut off his cheroots. Miss
Arabella wouldn&#8217;t forgive him for abandoning &#8216;that
charming Mr. Waddy.&#8217; However, she consoled herself
with Miromenil, that sprig of the <i>haute noblesse</i>.
You will find them all at Newport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine lad, Dunstan,&#8221; said Waddy, &#8220;but somewhat
melancholy&mdash;probably spent too much money
in Europe. Perhaps he&#8217;s lost his heart to Miss
Waddie; but he didn&#8217;t talk like a disappointed lover;
only sad, not bitter. Well, when I&#8217;ve finished my
business here and Granby comes, I may as well begin
my home experience with Newport&mdash;as well there
as anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the cobbler, being shaken, responded with
only a death-rattle of dry ice, Mr. Waddy lighted
his cheroot and strolled into the Common. It was
loveliest moonlight. He sat on a bench reclined
against an elm. The policeman coming by, stopped,
willing to chat of crime. It was too pure a night
for any thought save reveries of pensive peace; so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Waddy gagged him with a cigar. An hour afterward,
at midnight, the same, re-passing, found the
smoker still posted on his bench.</p>

<p>So for hours of that delicious night of summer
he sat beneath the flickering elm shadows. Sweet
breezes from overland, where roses were, came and
played among the branches. There was no sorrow
nor sighing in the voices of this summer wind&mdash;only
love, love! Did Mr. Waddy hear them? Had some
hopeful Cupid peered into his face, he would have
fled affrighted at its stern misery.</p>

<p>Across the ripples and beyond the silver islands of
the bay, at Nahant, where one of the first hops of the
season was now careering, the Wilkes party were
spending a day or two. They were all hopping merrily
to-night, Gyas the brave and the brave Cloanthus
alternating with Miss Julia. Miss Milly Center
had also been brought down to join the Wilkeses, by
her Boston friends; and Mr. Billy Dulger, moth to
her flame, had followed, disregarding the claims of
his papa&#8217;s counting-house in New York. They all
danced and flirted and were well pleased, though
not very susceptible truly to the exalting influences
of the moonlit sea.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan&#8217;s dancing days were over, except
when she was kind enough to practice with a
d&eacute;butante, or teach some awkward youth the graces
in a turn or two. The music, however, was fine, and
the girls, at first, fresh and not all crumpled. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
she, too, was pleased with the pretty sight. But it
grew no prettier, and presently she walked away
from the hotel out upon the rocks. The music
mingled softly with the plashing sea. The fall of
waves was like the trembling of many leaves; each
dot of water on the dark rocks was a diamond, filled
with a diminished moon. Here, too, was the breeze
that told of love; the lulling beat of waves said
softly love, and the great, dreamy, mysterious sea,
over all its brilliant and shimmering calm, seemed
permeated by an infinite spirit of eternal love.
Looking out upon it, Miss Sullivan&#8217;s face softened
and saddened, and her eyes filled again with tears.</p>

<p>About this time, Mr. Waddy, on his bench in
Boston Common, feeling that the end of his third
cheroot was about to frizzle the tips of his moustache,
was taking a last, long puff, when a mosquito,
suddenly sailing in, nipped his nose. The sufferer
immediately discovered that his life was a burden.
He threw away his stump with great violence,
walked back to his hotel, and laid down his burden
under a mosquito-bar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<span class="small">OUR HERO RENEWS HIS YOUTH IN THE WARMTH<br />
OF AN OLD FRIENDSHIP</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS Mr. Waddy was glancing over his paper at
breakfast next morning, he caught sight of a
name once familiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I did wrong,&#8221; thought he, not for the
first time, &#8220;to close all intercourse with people here
when I went away. &#8216;Perkins &amp; Tootler&#8217; advertising
everywhere. There can&#8217;t be two men named
Tootler. It must be my old schoolfellow. I&#8217;ll go
down and see if he remembers me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Large letters in the directory informed him of the
firm&#8217;s address&mdash;Perkins &amp; Tootler, wool merchants,
Throgmorton Perkins, Thomas Tootler. Ira easily
found the store. Everything looked busy and prosperous.
The air around was filled with a fine flocculent
haze which caused Mr. Waddy to rub his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy doesn&#8217;t need to advertise that he&#8217;s in
wool,&#8221; thought he. &#8220;In clover, too, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>All within the store of P. &amp; T. was bustle. Wool-gathering
there meant quite the opposite of witlessness.
In reply to Mr. Waddy&#8217;s inquiry for Mr.
Tootler, a busy clerk pointed to the inner office.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
The door was shut, and as Mr. Waddy knocked,
he heard a queer, suppressed sound, half musical,
half melancholy, like the wheeze of a country church
organ when Bellows, immersed in his apple, has
forgotten his duty of blast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said a voice.</p>

<p>As Ira entered, the person within was engaged in
hurrying something into the pocket of his grey
morning coat. The person was a short, bald, jolly
fatling, all abloom with pink freshness. He looked
a compound of <i>p&egrave;re de famille</i> and jolly dog. His
abiding rosiness was rosier now with a blush as of
one detected; it grew ruddier as the stranger addressed
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Tootler, I believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; will you take a seat?&#8221; returned Tootler
politely; then, as he saw his visitor in clearer light,
he sprang to his feet, with hands outstretched. &#8220;Is
it possible? Why, Waddy, is it you? <i>Folly ol tolly
ol tilly ol ta!</i>&#8221; and he grasped Ira&#8217;s hands and
hopped before him in a polka step. As he hopped,
his coat flew about and a hard object in the pocket
struck Mr. Waddy&#8217;s leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s I, Tommy, my boy,&#8221; said Waddy, almost
ready to dance himself and feeling, suddenly,
quite a boy again. &#8220;I would bet cash that I can tell
what you have in your right-hand pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re right,&#8221; admitted Tootler, smiling
blandly; and diving into his pocket, he produced the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
joints of a flute. He put it rapidly together and
after one howl, such as Ira had heard from without,
he played in a masterly way a few bars of a sweet
Spanish air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our last serenade&mdash;eh, Ira? I don&#8217;t forget, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two friends shook hands again on this souvenir&mdash;but
more gravely. Mr. Waddy&#8217;s face, indeed,
was again very grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen years ago this very month,&#8221; continued
Tootler, a little rapidly, perhaps noticing the change.
&#8220;But, Ira, you&#8217;ve not altered a hair, except your
moustache, and you&#8217;re as brown as a chowder party.
Splendid! All right! Welcome home! as the boy
said to the bumble-bee. If I could see your lips, I
don&#8217;t know but I would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; A chirping smack
went off in the air, and Tommy, the gay, spun about
his office, and as he spun he flirted no less than three
tears to lay the dust; then, giving himself a little
thwack in the eyes, he fronted Waddy again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Tommy,&#8221; said his friend, &#8220;you are the
same&mdash;only younger. I see the hair hasn&#8217;t grown
yet on your infantile poll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never will, sir,&#8221; replied the merry man, who
had plenty of pleasant light hair below his tonsure;
&#8220;never would. I&#8217;m taken for a priest, a nunshow.
Sometimes for the Pope. Isn&#8217;t that worth being
bald for? &#8216;The Pope that Pagan full of pride&#8217;&mdash;I&#8217;d
like to be him for one day to excommunicate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Irish nation. But come! tell me about yourself. I
obeyed orders and didn&#8217;t write. I heard, of course,
through your house here that you were alive and
making money, but nothing more. We&#8217;ve talked
very often of you&mdash;Cissy and I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Waddy, &#8220;of course there&#8217;s a Cissy.
No man ever looked so young and happy without.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; assented Tootler positively,
&#8220;there&#8217;s more than one. There&#8217;s Mrs. Cecilia
Tootler, who knows you very well by hearsay, and
Miss Cecilia Tootler, who will know you this afternoon,
if my brown mare Cecilia doesn&#8217;t break our
necks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going so fast?&#8221; asked Waddy,
&#8220;with these gay young men who drive brown
mares?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to my house in the country,&#8221; explained
Tootler. &#8220;We are going to drive and drive
and talk over old times, and have some iced punch
after the old fashion, and a pipe after punch. For
your part, you are going to be made love to by Mrs.
Tootler; she shall sing to you, with her divinest
voice, everything that you have loved in old times,
and a thousand new things that you will love when
you hear them; she shall play to you on the dulcinea,
sackbut, psaltery, spinnet, harp, lute, and
every kind of instrument, including a piano. Her
name was a prophecy&mdash;there&#8217;s something in a name.
Now yours&mdash;I don&#8217;t believe you would have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
bolting off to India as you did, forgetting all your
friends, if your name had not been Ira.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more o&#8217; that, Tommy,&#8221; protested Ira, &#8220;now
that one of my friends has proved that he has not
forgotten me. But tell me, is it usual for merchants
of Boston, in wool or out of it, to carry pocket
flutes or bassoons, and while away the noontide hour
with dulcet strains, such as you gave me? Do they
all play solos in solitude?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They might do worse, and some of &#8217;em do.
The fact is, Ira, I meet such a set of inharmonious
knaves that I must soothe me with a little blow now
and then. I have had the doors felted. Not much
sound goes through. Generally, I can wait till I
get to the Shrine&mdash;so I call my box&mdash;St. Cecilia&#8217;s
Shrine&mdash;for my music, but sometimes these confounded
beggars rasp me so with their mean tricks
and tempting swindles that I have to pipe up. The
clerks wait till I&#8217;ve done and then ask for half-holidays.
I have to deal with a pretty shabby crew.
These manufacturers are always hard up and keep
sending a lot of daggered scallawags here to get
contributions to put little bills through Congress
about the tariff. They don&#8217;t get much out of
Tommy Tootler&mdash;nor much ahead of him&mdash;the
loafers!&#8221; and Tommy, to tranquillise his soul, took
his flute and gave &#8220;Il segreto&#8221; with thrilling trills.</p>

<p>As he closed, a small knock smote the door and
the youngest clerk, aged fifteen, peered in. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
pantaloons were hitched up by his hasty descent from
a high stool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Tootler,&#8221; he began timidly, but gathering
courage at every word, &#8220;my sisters are going to
have a raspberry party this evening and&mdash;and my
mother&#8217;s not very well. Can I go home at three?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go along, my boy!&#8221; said the merchant, &#8220;and
don&#8217;t take too many raspberries or you may be
more ill than your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clerkling disappeared and a suppressed cheer
came through the felted door.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy laughed heartily. Tootler also
smiled in length and breadth; in breadth over his
rosy cheeks of indigenous cheerfulness, and in
greater length from where his chin showed the
cloven dimple up to the apex of his tonsure. It was
doing Mr. Waddy vast good&mdash;this intercourse with
his old comrade. It seems to me quite possible that
if he had found his friend transmuted from the old
nimble sixpence to a slow shilling&mdash;corrupted into a
man of the two-and-sixpenny type, slim, prim, close,
pious to the point of usury&mdash;that the returning man
would have been disgusted away from all his possibilities
of content and hopes of home; would have
scampered back to the lounges of Europe and there
withered away. Then, certes, never would this tale
of his Return have been written.</p>

<p>But Mr. Waddy found his old friend now even
more a friend. The meeting carried each back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the dear days of youth, jolly and joyous, ardent,
generous, unsuspecting. How many were left who
could call either by prenomen? These were two
who, together, had done all the boyish mischiefs&mdash;all
for which boyhood is walloped and riper years
remember with delight. Had they not together
lugged away the furtive watermelon? What Boston
bell-pulls were not familiar with their runaway
rings? Who, as time went on, were the best
skaters but they? Who went farthest for water
lilies for boyish sweethearts; who, into stickiest
mud for the second joints of that amphibious kangaroo,
the frog? To enumerate their joint adventures
and triumphs demands a folio. Were this
written, the old types of friendship would be forgotten,
and even now, as I think of Waddy and
Tootler, those other duos of history, Orestes and
Pythias, Damon and Jonathan, Pylades and David,
mingle themselves like uncoupled hounds&mdash;their
conjunctions seem only casual and temporary.</p>

<p>There must have been good reason for their reciprocal
silence during so many years, for their
meeting was not as of two who have wished to forget
each other, and such a meeting, with so unchanged
a comrade, was, as I have said, to Mr.
Waddy a wondrous good. It seems impossible that
a man of his many noble traits should not have had
other friends, all in their way as sincere as this
one. But whether this prove to be so or not, here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
we have the first fact a favourable fact. The first
hand he grasps returns the pressure warmly, and not
with traitorous warmth. The first face he recognises
even precedes his in recognition. Pleasant
omens these! If not ominous, pleasant enough as
facts.</p>

<p>The two friends parted for their morning business.
At three, to a tick, Mr. Tootler was at the
Tremont House, in a knowing buggy with hickory
wheels, fresh-varnished. Mr. Waddy, also to a
tick, ready with his carpet-bag, squinted at Cecilia
and saw that she was a &#8220;good un.&#8221; Mr. Tootler,
with his tonsure covered by a straw hat, was a very
young, almost boyish-looking man, as vivacious and
sparkling as a lively boy. Mr. Waddy was browner
and graver, and his long moustache gave a stern
character to his face, even when he smiled.</p>

<p>Cecilia lounged along over the stones down Beacon
Street, with that easy fling which reminds one of
the indolence of an able man. The air was cool and
fragrant, and parasol clouds hung overhead, suggesting
future need of umbrellas. The same need
was foreshadowed by gleaming fires in horizontal
blackness&mdash;they were evidently heating up those
dark reservoirs that later a diluvial boiling-over
might come.</p>

<p>Cecilia probably snuffed the approaching shower,
or was a little wild with thoughts of her oats, for
while Tootler was still pointing out to his friend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
the new houses of new men, the railroad causeways
and the extension of the Common, the mare was imperceptibly
and still lazily stretching into her speed.
She was not one of those great awkward brutes that
require a crowbar between the teeth and a capstan
with its crew at either rein. This refined, ladylike
animal had nothing of the wrong-headed vixen
about her. Her lively ears showed caution without
timidity. She was indeed a &#8220;good un,&#8221; with a pedigree
brought down by the Ark from Paradise.</p>

<p>Mr. Tootler hardly felt the reins, the mare was
minding herself. They were descending an easy
slope, when a man driving fast, alone in a buggy, appeared
over the opposite rise of ground. Just as
he came within recognisable distance, he struck his
horse violently with the whip; the horse winced and
bolted and then turned toward his own side a little,
but not enough to save the collision.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in,&#8221; said Tootler calmly, as the crash
came.</p>

<p>He had the advantage of down-hill impetus and a
large fore-wheel of the new style. His wheel struck
the other&#8217;s hinder wheel just in front of the box.
It swept the axle and both wheels clear. Cecilia
pulled up in an instant&mdash;no damage. They left her
standing and both sprang to the rescue of the
stranger. He had been thrown out behind and was
picking himself up from a spot where there was
just mud enough for general defilement. Ira made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
after the horse, who only ran a hundred yards, and
brought him back with the wreck of the wagon at
his heels. Tootler was talking rather angrily to
the stranger, who stood sulkily beating off the
mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it, Belden, you know it was your own
fault,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;Why the deuce did you hit
that bolter of yours just at the wrong time? You
might have broken all our necks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; said Belden, and the word expressed
many things.</p>

<p>He was, or rather had been, dressed in white,
with blue cravat, and wore a straw hat covered with
fresh white muslin in the Oriental style. He was
now bedaubed like Salius in the Virgilian foot-race.
It was quite certain that his afternoon projects were
at an end. He was an &#8220;object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; continued the good-natured Tootler,
&#8220;you have the worst of it and I won&#8217;t abuse you.
Here comes Waddy with your horse&mdash;he seems all
right. Don&#8217;t you remember Waddy? Ira, this is
Horace Belden. He used to be one of us&mdash;old
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Waddy was holding the horse with his right
hand; he held out the other with an apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you again and very sorry that
we were the unintentional cause of your accident,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Belden took the hand with a bad grace, and stooping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
down to wipe off some of his stains, was muttering
something that may have been a reply, when
Cecilia made a little start. Tootler jumped to her
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Waddy,&#8221; he called; &#8220;we shall be caught
in the shower. Sorry to leave you, Belden, but
don&#8217;t see that we can do anything. A little rain-water
won&#8217;t do you any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belden&#8217;s manner was so very ungracious that
Waddy&#8217;s cordiality, if he felt any, was repressed.
It was a case for indulgence, however, and he paused
an instant as he was mounting into the buggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at the Tremont House, Mr. Belden,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and shall be glad to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tremont House&mdash;ah,&#8221; replied the other.
&#8220;Hold your head up, you damn beast!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the pair drove off, Belden looked after them
with a black expression and a curse.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the hell has that damned Waddy come
back for?&#8221; he asked of the ambient air. &#8220;He&#8217;d
better keep away from me. I knew him as soon as
I saw him from the top of the hill. You infernal
brute, why didn&#8217;t you go by?&#8221; and picking up his
whip, Mr. Horace Belden beat his horse villainously.</p>

<p>Meantime Cecilia was tossing herself gracefully
along, covering ground to make up for delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Belden owe you any money?&#8221; asked
Tommy. &#8220;I thought there seemed something to
pay between you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>&#8220;He certainly didn&#8217;t seem inclined to pay even
common civility,&#8221; replied Ira, &#8220;but I suppose he was
savage at being spilt. It <i>was</i> rather hard, particularly
with that gay and gorgeous raiment. He
should learn how to drive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he knew us and meant to go by without
notice,&#8221; said Tommy shrewdly. &#8220;Did you ever
quarrel with him before you went away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never any positive quarrel. I had begun to distrust
him somewhat; but he aided me so readily in
my efforts to be off that I forgot my doubts. We
parted good friends. Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly say,&mdash;something in his look, and
manner of speaking of you, as of course we did
often. I noticed the same look to-day, when he
used the whip, and when you came back with the
horse. Depend on it, he wishes you no good. I
don&#8217;t like to speak ill of any man, but I believe him
to be a scamp. My wife would never know him.
I ask her why, and she says she has an instinctive
aversion to him. I am sure she has had something
to verify her intuitions. She is not a person
for idle fancies, except in my personal case, and
then I had trouble enough to change fancy into
fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has Belden been doing all these years?&#8221;
asked Waddy. &#8220;The only time I ever heard of him
personally was a year or so after I went, when a
youth who came to China to forget some jilting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
miss, told me that he was to marry a lady at whose
house we used to meet&mdash;you know,&#8221; and he turned
away so that his companion might not see his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was nothing in that,&#8221; said Tommy.
&#8220;Soon after you went, he ceased to be received there&mdash;reasons
unknown. He was a pretty hard customer
then, and played high. Then he got some reputation
of a certain kind in an amatory way. By-and-by
the house failed&mdash;total smash&mdash;not a dollar
to be found; still his connections and power of making
himself agreeable, particularly to women of the
class who haven&#8217;t intuitions, or don&#8217;t consult them,
kept him up. He&#8217;s rather accomplished&mdash;sings, you
know, and writes what half-educated people call
clever things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have a large audience,&#8221; observed Ira, a
little bitterly, even for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has,&#8221; agreed Tootler; &#8220;among knaves as
well as fools. It&#8217;s my belief the fellow would steal.
In fact, where he got his money to go and live in
Europe, as he did for several years, no one knows,
unless he hid it from the firm&#8217;s creditors. Then he
went to California and pretended to have made his
fortune. He has lately been to Europe again. I
believe he is now on the matrimonial lay, the beggar!
But you don&#8217;t ask me about the other friends
with whom we used to be so intimate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy, with the tone of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
definitely putting aside the subject. &#8220;I do not.
How that mare of yours travels! Can you put me
in the way of getting a horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what work? My next neighbour has a
five-year-old, Cecilia&#8217;s half-brother, for sale. He&#8217;s
a beauty, black as the devil. The only thing against
him is, he&#8217;s not broke to harness. They ask a loud
price, too. It will make you stare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very easy to make me stare,&#8221; said Waddy
easily. &#8220;A saddle horse is just my affair. We&#8217;ll
look at him in the morning, and if he suits, &#8216;Ho for
cavaliers!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>During all this talk, Mr. Waddy had not failed to
observe the exquisite beauty of the country they were
whizzing through. There is nothing so charming,
suburbanly, as the region about Boston, and to him
all was garden, for these were spots where his rosy-houred
youth had taken its truant pleasures.
Fifteen years had built fences of exclusion round
many lovely groves, where he had chestnutted; the
old orchards were cut down or neglected; many
things had changed, for the city was steadily growing
countrywards. He had only time to make hasty
observations as they passed. Tootler would have
been glad to pull up for larger view of fine house
or finished grounds or lovely rural landscape, but
that imperious shower said no. Presently they
turned off the highroad into a sylvan lane, between
tall hedges. A desultory avenue of elms shaded it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
On one side was a gravel walk, along which a little
girl was driving a hoop towards them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump in, Cissy,&#8221; called Tootler, pulling in the
mare.</p>

<p>A charming bright-eyed damsel clambered in and
began to fondle her father. Her smile had the same
bright, cheerful, magical charm as his.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my friend, Mr. Waddy,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Give him a kiss&mdash;or, better still, one for every year
he has been away from his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again Mr. Waddy felt his heart glow with a
warmth almost youthful as the fresh red lips touched
his.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<span class="small">IN WHICH THE READER IS ALLOWED TO WORSHIP<br />
AT THE SHRINE</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IF this were a three-volumed novel, here would
expand a wondrous chance for a luxuriant,
George Robbinsy description of that delightful rural
retreat, the villa of Thomas Tootler, Esq. But
though we enjoy the bliss and comfort of that
worthy, we must leave his accessories to be imagined
from the man. Of course he had a house, not too
large, not too small for the pleasant actual trio of
his family, and extensible to include future possibilities.
Of course grounds were worthy of house,
garden of grounds, fruits of garden.</p>

<p>The equine Cecilia walked slowly up the hill and
lounged into the gate, no longer caring to hasten
her certainty of oaten banquet, or spoil her appetite
by trepidation. A fine-looking darkey stepped forward
and took her head, while the gentlemen descended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fugitive slave,&#8221; whispered Mr. Tootler. &#8220;Jefferson
Lee Compton Davis&mdash;first families of Virginia
on the father&#8217;s side and on the maternal grandfather&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>Little Cecilia had scampered away at once, and
now reappeared, bright as a cherub in a sunbeam,
leading her mother by the hand. At sight of the
stranger, this lady checked herself at the threshold.
But she had evidently, as Mr. Tootler said, heard
already of Mr. Waddy, and when her husband presented
him by name, she stepped forward with a
shy tremble of diffident friendliness lovely to
behold.</p>

<p>If Mr. Tootler had fittingly represented the masculine
side of friendship, Mrs. Tootler as sincerely
acted the feminine part. It was not merely the few
cordial words, expressing her pleasure at meeting
her husband&#8217;s old friend, to whom he owed so much
in so many ways, but the frank grasp of the hand,
the bright look of genuine welcome in the clear
brown eyes, the blush of warm interest, the winning
smile as she introduced the friend into a home, as he
must henceforth feel it&mdash;all this was more and more
on the side of happiness. Mr. Waddy was again
conscious of that unaccustomed feeling overcoming
him, like a summer cloud full of summer&#8217;s joyful
tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tootler left them to give orders about the
fatted calf and icing the champagne. Tommy conducted
his friend to his room, and both, with their
coats off, were commencing their toilet, chatting
through an open door of communication, when there
came a sudden alarm from little Cecilia.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>&#8220;Papa!&#8221; she cried, running up the stair, &#8220;come
quick! Some men are fighting Jefferson.&#8221;</p>

<p>The host and guest were down the stair and in the
barnyard in an instant. Four men were endeavouring
to put the Fugitive Slave Bill in operation.
Jefferson believed in the Declaration of Independence,
and was making wondrous play for freedom,
but four were too many for him. They had him
down and were producing handcuffs. Two of the
men were in the Virginia uniform of black dress-coat
and shiny satin waistcoat. The other two were
Deputy Marshals Hookey and Tucker.</p>

<p>It was beautiful as forked lightning to see Mr.
Tootler count himself in and make free with the
fight. He alighted like a bomb, unexpected, on one
Virginian who had his knee on the negro&#8217;s head.
This man, for reasons, appeared no more in the
fray. Ira, of course, followed his friend and occupied
himself with raising bumps on the countenance
of Marshal Tucker. Jefferson Davis, once released,
soon floored the second Virginian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut, Jeff, and go to Sammy&#8217;s,&#8221; cried Tommy,
amidst his attentions to Hookey. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send your
clothes in the morning,&#8221; and Jeff was off in an instant.</p>

<p>The prey escaped, the two marshals preferred not
to be bruised further and called a truce. Virginian
No. 2 was quite groggy and <i>hors de combat</i>. Crackers,
the dog, had pounced upon his fellow-huntsman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
as he lay, and was smiling at him with very
white teeth. At this moment, with a neighbour
flash, bang went the big thunder-gun and down came
the deluge. The two gentlemen took refuge within,
leaving the vanquished to scamper for their carriage
with such speed as they were capable of. As the
heroes re-entered the house, they met Mrs. Tootler
rushing forward with a double-barrelled gun and
silver fish-knife. The black cook, with a distinct
cuisiney odor of fatted calf, was in the van, armed
with a gridiron and pitcher of steaming water.
This reserve was, however, needless as the Prussians
at Waterloo, and there was no pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Waddy,&#8221; said the host, &#8220;how are you?
Knuckles lame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the guest, &#8220;my man was rather
cushiony about the chops. Neither of us was much
hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital little shindy!&#8221; said Tommy, glowing
with satisfaction. &#8220;I think I shall take a station of
the Underground for the chances of such an appetiser
now and then. I haven&#8217;t felt such a meritorious
hunger for ages. Very likely we&#8217;ll be arrested
in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Battles in a worthy cause win favour with the fair.
Mrs. Cecilia looked a little anxiously for wounds, but
there were none save what a stitch might repair.
She plucked a rose for each, as a palm of victory.</p>

<p>At dinner, after the asphodel cauliflower, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
lotus celery, the <i>pommes d&#8217;amour</i> tomatoes, and the
amaranthine flower-adorned fruits, the friends talked
over this m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, sipping meanwhile their nectar coffee,
and wielding the nephelegeret sceptre of tobacco.
Mrs. Tootler was not to be weeded out.
They could not spare her presence, blithe and d&eacute;bonnaire,
nor in the discussion her unembarrassed
womanly rectitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be indignant, Tommy,&#8221; said Ira, &#8220;at
the intrusion of those kidnappers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately our moral sense on these subjects
is too much degraded,&#8221; answered Tommy. &#8220;I am
angry, of course, but I do not think half enough of
the infernal shame to that poor darkey. He must go
to Canada, just as much an exile as any of the foreigners
we make such disturbance about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may seem rather ignorant,&#8221; said Waddy,
&#8220;after my long absence, but tell me, do men with the
social position of gentlemen here accept office from
a government that is willing to make and execute
such laws as this Fugitive Slave Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Mere social position does not make
men gentlemen. They call themselves conservatives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said Ira, &#8220;that in the present
condition of things, a conservative must be either
an ignoramus, a coward, or a knave. But, madam,&#8221;
he added, turning to Mrs. Tootler, &#8220;we are boring
you with politics. <i>Parlons chiffons.</i>&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>&#8220;<i>Chiffons!</i>&#8221; cried Cecilia. &#8220;I am really indignant,
Mr. Waddy. I do not believe that the gentleman
so quietly smoking by your side would ever
have been really roused if I were not always buzzing
in his ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is right,&#8221; admitted Mr. Tootler, sipping the
last drops of his now cold coffee. &#8220;Women are vigorous
antidotes to moral or mental sleepiness. But,
Waddy, our little adventure is bringing the present
too near us; to-night must be devoted to recalling
our dear old days together. To-morrow we&#8217;ll talk
politics and be sad for the uncertainties of our cause&mdash;&#8216;ma
quest oggi n&#8217; &eacute; dato goder,&#8217;&#8221; he sang.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Non contiamo l&#8217; incerto domani,&#8217;&#8221; responded
Cecilia, with spirit, from the same air, &#8220;which I
freely translate that we do not count the future of
our cause uncertain at all, either to-morrow or
after.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a fascinating thing to see a lovely woman in
wrath, and probably Mr. Waddy thought for the
moment more of how startlingly bright were the
eyes of the lady, and how quick her heart&#8217;s blood
leaped to her vivid cheek, than of the cause that made
the eyes electric and the cheek burning.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife knows all the old songs, Ira,&#8221; said
Tommy, also gazing admiringly, but deeming it
discreet to change the subject, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve not forgotten
my stock. We&#8217;ll have the old first, as old
wine should come, and then, if satiety does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
interfere, you shall have new music till you cry
<i>basta</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Cecilia, the little storm over in an
instant, &#8220;I&#8217;ve learnt all your old favourites, Mr.
Waddy. We have always expected you and determined
to make you forget your sad absence,&#8221; and
then, as if she had been too frank and had betrayed
some confidence of husband and wife, she shrank a
little and folded into herself like a mimosa leaf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy simply.</p>

<p>So they had music. Mrs. Tootler&#8217;s voice was a
pearly soprano of more marked tenderness and sentiment
than you would have expected from her blithesomeness
of manner. Tommy&#8217;s was a barytone,
strong and rich; it rolled out of the happy little man
in a careless way, perpetually making musical ten-strikes.
Mr. Waddy sometimes contributed a bass
note, deep as an oubliette.</p>

<p>But it was his part to assist passively rather than
actively at the concert. He would have listened
quite forever, but at last the husband detected huskiness
and said punch. Thereupon he brewed a browst&mdash;tumblers
for the men, a wineglass for the lady.
They partook by the rising moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your plans?&#8221; asked Tommy. &#8220;You
will stay with us a week, or a month, or five years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no plans except to buy the black colt to-morrow.
I expect pretty soon an English friend,
and have promised to look up the lions with him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Apropos, perhaps you can put him in the way of
seeing your Boston dons. He is an accomplished
fellow, naturalist, man of science, charming companion,
and brave soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will find the Boston dons rather slow,&#8221; said
Tommy; &#8220;there is nothing soldierly about them.
A respectably studious and rather dyspeptic set.
Quite conventional and conscious of European influence.
But here&#8217;s to the midnight moon!&#8221; he
added, as that gibbous deity cleft the clouds and
seemed sailing upward through their stationary
masses. &#8220;One can see almost heaven and the
angels!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you look up yonder for them?&#8221;
queried Waddy, when the toast was drunk. &#8220;Your
life seems to me a revelation of earthly heaven, with
one abiding angelic presence. You think my rhapsodies
mere Oriental absurdities, perhaps, Mrs. Cecilia&mdash;but
it seems to me that my friend, with you,
has attained to happiness. You were always a
hopeful man, Tommy; now you seem by hopes
achieved to have learnt what they call Faith. Well,
you deserve it. For me, whatever I have deserved,
there is only a poor refuge of such careless stoicism
as I affect,&#8221; and he uttered in some strange tongue
an expression savage and stern as the growl of a
lion.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said he again, after a silence, during
which his friends had been, perhaps, seeking vainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
for the right word; &#8220;my dear Mrs. Cecilia, my first
evening at your lovely house shall not end sulkily on
my part. Tommy, unsheathe your jocund flute and
draw thenceforth soul-animating strains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy was not one of those non-performing
humbugs, noticed by Socrates as existing in his
time, who are uniformly out of practice or have
left their notes at home, so he got out his flute immediately,
and accompanied Cecilia in a delicious
echo song, the silver sounds threading themselves
among the fine moonbeams that floated through the
network of vines over the piazza where they sat.
With the last fading echo, drifted away every
thought of bitterness, and the calm midnight silence
fell around them peacefully. So they separated.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy stood at the window of his bedroom,
looking out upon the night. Was it to the spirit of
the night that he stretched forth his arms and murmured
words of yearning tenderness? His hand
was feeling, as if unconsciously, in his bosom. He
missed something.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Testament!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Ah, now I
remember&mdash;the wreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lighted a cigar, but after a puff or two, threw
it away and turned in. His health was excellent,
despite the memories which troubled him from time
to time, and after the long day diversified with incidents
of collision and shindy, he slept solidly, not
far from the scenes of old happiness, lost long ago.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<span class="small">THE PARABLE OF A HUMBLE BEAST OF BURDEN AND<br />
OF LILIES THAT TOIL NOT</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BREAKFAST, with Cecilia to preside, was
bright as summer sunrise. Little Cecilia had
her bouquet of dewy roses for father and friend.
The whiff of coffee perfume was like a gale of Araby
the blest. Just as the meal was ended, a servant announced
that Mr. Bishop was outside with a horse.
They sallied forth to inspect it.</p>

<p>Mr. Bishop was a flashy man, not quite jockey,
not quite farmer, rather of the squireen type. He
had associated enough with gentlemen to know how
they permit themselves to slang and swear. He was,
however, better than a gentleman jockey, who, like
a gentleman stool-pigeon, is doubly dangerous.
But no jockey could say more for the black horse
than was evident in every bend of his body, in
every tense muscle and chord of the delicate limbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is high-couraged, sir,&#8221; said Bishop, &#8220;and
has played the devil with some folks. You seem to
know how to handle a horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Waddy ran his hand over the legs, as free from
knots as a Malacca joint; then standing at his head,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
he let the colt nibble at a bit of moist biscuit and
took the opportunity quietly to look at his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems all right,&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;Move
him a little, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bishop started him off. The stride and spring
were smooth as a raw oyster; both told of speed and
power.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no mistake about him,&#8221; said Bishop,
bringing him back. &#8220;I meant to have kept him to
ride myself, but times is gittin&#8217; hard [<i>i. e.</i>, brandy
has gone up]. Besides, my daughter, Sally, is gittin&#8217;
sicker an&#8217; I&#8217;ll have to go south with her next winter
and shan&#8217;t need no horse, an&#8217; &#8217;ll want the rocks. Mr.
Tootler knows the horse an&#8217; kin tell you what he
did when we tried him on the course. If you buy
him an&#8217; &#8217;ll keep dark, you&#8217;ll be mighty apt to take
&#8217;em down that tries to run with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take him,&#8221; said Ira, without more parley.
&#8220;Tootler, will you give Mr. Bishop your check?&#8221;</p>

<p>While Tootler was drawing the check, Cecilia
came out with a small basket. She offered it to
Bishop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been putting up some jelly for Miss
Sally,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It may tempt her. How is she
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best to be said,&#8221; replied Bishop, &#8220;is she
ain&#8217;t gittin&#8217; no wus. The doctor says she ain&#8217;t so
much sick as down in the mouth. She&#8217;s off her feed
an&#8217; seems to have got suthin&#8217; on her mind. P&#8217;r&#8217;aps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
it&#8217;s religion. She wants me to stop swearin&#8217;; but
I&#8217;ll be durned if I kin. I wish you&#8217;d come over an&#8217;
see her ag&#8217;in, ma&#8217;am. You&#8217;re the only one as does
her any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with evident feeling and sincerity, and
Mrs. Tootler promised to go.</p>

<p>A moment later, Mr. Tootler emerged from the
house and handed Bishop the check. The black was
transferred to Mr. Waddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to part with him,&#8221; said Bishop, real
regret in his voice; &#8220;but you look like you&#8217;d treat
him well, sir. He ain&#8217;t used to the whip. He&#8217;s
never been struck but once, when that damn Belden
talked of buyin&#8217; him. Belden handled him kind er
careless an&#8217; then give him a crack. I guess he got
dropped easy&mdash;the fool! He&#8217;s had a spite agin the
horse ever since, an&#8217; I&#8217;m kind er glad to git him out
o&#8217; the way of any mean trick. Belden&#8217;s a kind o&#8217;
feller not to fergit it when any critter&#8217;s been too
much fer him&mdash;horse or man or woman, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the horse for a moment, and then
walked away, turning to look back once or twice
regretfully, but consoling himself by the expensive
check, subscribed by a man well known in State
Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember Sally Bishop?&#8221; asked
Tootler of his friend. &#8220;A very handsome girl she
was&mdash;poor thing!&mdash;dying now. Seems to me you
used to go with Belden to see her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>&#8220;I knew her slightly,&#8221; replied Waddy, in a tone
the reverse of encouraging. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bad thing to
have intimacies with second-rate women. If you
have a saddle,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that will fit my horse,
I&#8217;ll ride him in to town now. By the way, what
shall I name him? He&#8217;s as black as death&mdash;&#8216;mors,
pallida mors&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s it&mdash;Pallid! I&#8217;ll call him by
rule of contraries. Pal, for short; we shall be pals,
eh, old boy?&#8221; and he caressed the horse, who responded
in kind, instinctively knowing a friend.</p>

<p>Pallid was larger than Cecilia, but her saddle was
well enough for the short ride. Tootler was obliged
to be in the wool again early. Jefferson Davis not
being present to preside over the cavalry, the gardener
laid down the shovel and the hoe and took up
the curry-comb. Pallid was, of course, resplendent
for the sale, as a bride is when her bargain is
ratified.</p>

<p>Waddy was proud of his acquisition. Every fine
fellow has something of the caballero in his nature.
My friend, Misogynist, says a horse is the most beautiful
animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman! glorious woman!&#8221; I suggest enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good to look at,&#8221; M. admits, &#8220;but bad to go.
Be kind to the horse, and he is grateful and will not
try to harm you. But woman&mdash;the more you let her
have her head, the more she will try to throw you.
Bah! my kingdom for a horse; he shall be king; no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
bedizened woman sovereign for me! Look at his
smooth, brilliant coat&mdash;no pomade there! See
that easy motion; <i>incedat rex</i>. Think of his simple
toilet! two blankets, thick and thin. Yes, noble
comrade! I will be no carpet knight, nor dwindle
away with ridiculous sighs before shrines of plastic
dough images, or of models of brassiness, but with
thee will I away over boundlessness. Plains vast as
the sea await our gallop. Charge!&#8221;</p>

<p>So far Misogynist&mdash;I will add that of the two
classes of animals, horses are cheaper to keep, and
when you have them, are yours, and not the property
of the first admirer.</p>

<p>The gardener brought Cecilia to the door, shining
from her morning toilet. Lady Cecilia, with the
lesser lady, came to bid the guest adieu. Lady and
child bore flowers of midsummer to be <i>rus in urbe</i> for
the gentlemen. Cecilia was charming in her morning
dress. As she said good-bye, the sparkle of her
brown eyes was brighter, the blush warmer, the
voice more musical, the shy tremor of friendliness
more graceful. &#8220;Happy Tootler!&#8221; thought Waddy;
&#8220;one of the rare few who are appointed to be illustrations
to others of happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come again soon,&#8221; said Cecilia. &#8220;A
room in our house has become yours. You must inhabit
it to keep ghosts from colonising. You too,
perhaps, are in some danger of companionship of
glooms, which are certainly as bad as ghosts. Come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
here always and we will sing them away. I have a
dozen plans for you already for summer and winter&mdash;and
then I intend you for a husband for little
Cissy here. What do you think of it, Cissy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know, mamma,&#8221; said Cissy seriously.
&#8220;I should wish to ask papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite precociously right, my dear,&#8221; commended
Mr. Waddy; &#8220;a lesson to your imprudent mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not imprudent, Cissy,&#8221; corrected Tootler.
&#8220;You are wise to get the first refusal of our nabob.
There will be hordes of matrons after him, like
wolves after a buffalo, and they&#8217;ll run him down unless
he accepts his fate and consents to be shot beforehand.
But come, Ira, I must voyage Boston-ward
for the golden fleece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I go to New York this evening for a few days on
business,&#8221; added Waddy. &#8220;Good-bye, till I return.
A kiss, little Cissy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy said good-bye to his wife, and her bright
smile went with him, as ever, and her glad voice
sang about him in every silent moment of his busy
day.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy rode slowly along, trying Pallid
through his paces. The beautiful head, unchecked
by any martingale, shook and tossed in the freedom
of a masculine coquetry. To control him was like
managing the moods of a wild woman&mdash;charming
distraction. Ira did not wish to trot him,&mdash;he was
not to be a roadster,&mdash;but he gave Cecilia a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
brush on a level. She was somewhere after the race,
but it was lengths in the rear.</p>

<p>At the Tremont, Chin Chin was in waiting. The
friends parted, and Mr. Waddy turned his face New
Yorkward, in kindlier mood than he had known for
many years.</p>

<p>That town, however, was not calculated to encourage
moods of cheerfulness. He had seen others
larger, several cleaner, many handsomer. It was
hot, and mosquitoes were about.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy&#8217;s arrival was announced in the papers
among &#8220;distinguished strangers.&#8221; Old De Flournoy
Budlong saw the name and called upon its
owner in the evening. About matters personal to
himself, Mr. Waddy talked little. He had not mentioned
even to Tootler the incident of his wreck.
But Mr. Budlong was too much occupied with his
private affairs to question the mode of Mr. Waddy&#8217;s
arrival. The red silk pocket handkerchief of other
days abode with him still, in flaunting defiance of the
modern elegance of his family. In his talk, he used
it freely on a forehead whose heated, anxious colouring
might pale the cochineal of its polisher. He
had much to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the ladies?&#8221; was naturally Mr.
Waddy&#8217;s first question.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are at Newport, sir,&#8221; answered Bud,
with a queer mixture of pride and apprehension.
&#8220;They&#8217;re at the Millard House. De Flournoy, Jr.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
is with them. It&#8217;s very expensive, sir. Why, it&#8217;s remarkable
how that boy has to subscribe&mdash;five hundred
dollars the first week! Subscriptions he says
to the club and balls and picnics&mdash;I should judge he
is very popular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; commented Ira.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Frenchman is with them, too,&#8221; continued
Bud. &#8220;What do you think of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damned low beggar!&#8221; said Ira tersely.</p>

<p>Bud visibly brightened and polished himself in
vigorous approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; he agreed; &#8220;I respect your judgment,
sir. I want Mrs. B. to drop his acquaintance;
but she says he belongs to the hot nubbless, whatever
that is. Why, sir, that Frenchman haunts me like
a flea. Everything I eat tastes of frogs! And then
Tim&#8217;s subscriptions&mdash;five hundred dollars in one
week! Why, sir, that would make him a life member
and director of the Bible Society and the Tract
Society and the Foreign Missions!&#8221; and the poor
man fell to polishing himself again with his piratical
handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go to look after them before next week,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;if then. You see, I&#8217;ve got a little
operation in flour. It&#8217;ll pay subscriptions, get him
on the corn exchange, and Budlong is himself
again. But it&#8217;s dull music staying in town. I&#8217;m at
the Astor. Everybody&#8217;s away and there&#8217;s no
peaches,&#8221; and old Bud, who had been working hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
all his days, and now was more than willing to lead
a life of jolly quiet, went off excessively disquieted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the old story,&#8221; thought Ira, as he closed the
door behind his friend. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for him. This
is a case to put in the scale against Tootler. But it
demands a whole cityful of Budlongs to over-balance
one righteous man like Tommy and his
family. Mrs. Tootler almost revives my faith in
women, and I had thought that gone forever after
that experience which nearly made my life a ruin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a well-built ruin, though,&#8221; he thought,
glancing at the mirror, &#8220;and especially sound in the
treasure-vaults. I would not quarrel with my experience
for making me the man I have become, were
it not that my isolation of bitter distrust in the one
I most trusted has secluded me from all the chances
of common happiness. And yet there are others
sharing the same exile, bearing a heavier burden,
who present a brave face to the world, even a cheerful
one&mdash;for instance, Granby&mdash;married in a freak
of boyish generosity to a vulgar, drunken termagant!
Suppose I had fallen into the same mistake?
Suppose I had married Sally Bishop; is it likely that
I should have learnt to control the old Ira of my
nature?</p>

<p>&#8220;All my voyage from Europe homeward, there
was droning in my ears the monotonous refrain of a
sad Spanish song, &#8216;Se acab&ograve; para mi l&#8217;esperanza.&#8217;
I heard it in the gale, the moment our schooner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
struck, and I thought &#8216;now the old earthly hopes are
dead with my death, and new hopes of other lives
shall be.&#8217; As I lay in my trance, all the old bitterness
passed away, and the old hopes grew fresh and
confident again as in happy days before disappointment;
and then the presence that was the joy of
those days came near, and I seemed to have attained
to dearest death and to a moment of heaven
that should interpret all the cruel mysteries of existence.
And I seemed to hear again the voice that
flowed so deliciously through my youth and made
my heart first know what heart-beats mean. But it
was not death I had attained, only a vision, such as
my waking life could never have, and when I really
woke again in Dempster&#8217;s house, it was to the melancholy
of the same refrain, &#8216;Se acab&ograve; para mi
l&#8217;esperanza.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment more he sat and stared down into
the street with heavy eyes that saw not&mdash;what was it
brought before him the face of Sally Bishop and
beside it another face, her face&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He shook himself impatiently and cast his dark
thoughts from him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<span class="small">THE READER IS PRESENTED TO TWO CHARMING GIRLS,<br />
AND SO IS MAJOR GRANBY</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AND now while a certain Peter Skerrett, stupendous
wag, who is in town for a day or two
and has been presented to Mr. Waddy by old Budlong,
is showing the returned nabob through streets
of deserted houses and telling him the necessary protective
scandals about their owners:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And while at Newport, in the society of De
Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant, Tim Budlong is subscribing more
freely than ever, and the Budlong ladies are quivering
through the <i>ter-diurnal</i> shift of toilets resplendent:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And while Sally Bishop, who has heard from her
father how he had sold the black to a Mr. Ira
Waddy, just returned from India, is dying with
something on her mind which she dare not yet reveal:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And while Horace Belden is beating his bolting
horse and training another, to which he naturally
gives the name of Knockknees, to run, and no doubt
to win purses, and is nursing his finances for an
August at Newport with its possible heiress:&mdash;&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>And while Miss Sullivan, at her lovely cottage opposite
Belden&#8217;s, is singing duets with Mrs. Cecilia
Tootler, to whom, though that lady has often spoken
of the delightful visit of Mr. Waddy, her friend, she
has never yet mentioned her share in the rescue of a
person of that name:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>While all our acquaintances are busied thus,
Major Granby, at Halifax, boards a Cunarder, embarked
for Boston. As he mounted the plank, a
young excessively English man defended the gangway
with open fist. The major won his entrance by
grasping the fist in amicable guise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how d&#8217;ye do, Ambient?&#8221; he said to his
compatriot, a pleasant-faced pinkling. &#8220;So you
have really started on your travels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw! Gwanby, I&#8217;m vewy glad to see you,&#8221; replied
Sir Comeguys Ambient, generally called briefly Sir
Com. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve begun my jowney wound the
wowuld. It&#8217;s lownger than I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had some pleasant company, anyway,&#8221;
said the major, examining discreetly two young
ladies who stood near the rail, and who, seemingly,
found much to interest them in the shoreward
view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; doosed handsome gerwuls,&#8221; agreed Sir
Com, &#8220;and vewy agweeable, but know too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly in your line then, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m weelly a little afwaid of them,&#8221; admitted the
valiant youth. &#8220;But the dark one is a wegular stunner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
for eyes and hair. The fair one is Miss Clara
Waddie. The bwunette is her friend, Diana,&#8221; and
the pinkling&#8217;s cheeks became all suffused with his ingenuous
heart&#8217;s blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Granby, observing the suffusion, &#8220;so
that goddess&mdash;and she is a goddess&mdash;has transfixed
you! Beware how you trifle with her; these American
ladies do not hesitate to call a man out. Your
Diana is divine, but your Clara is angelic. Waddy?
I have a friend of that name. I&#8217;m going now to
meet him in Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the course of the day, Major Granby, who had
a soldier-like impetuosity in assaulting new opportunities,
was presented to Waddie <i>p&egrave;re</i> and by him
to the ladies.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie of New York was a tall, slender
gentleman, clean-shaven and high-cravatted. A bit
of white collar on each side narrowed his range of
chin movement. Dignity required that his head
should not gyrate, hence sidelong glances were only
effected by a painful twist of his eyes. He wore a
blue frock, buttoned, and remarkably perfect boots.
His manner was a little stiff, but entirely well-bred,
and had a certain careful courtesy very attractive.
Altogether, you would say, a man of limited, but
not narrow mind, gentle and amiable. His passion
was genealogy, and if he was ever querulous, it was
when inevitable antiquaries connected him with the
first Waddy, well known to all American pedigrees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
cook of the <i>Mayflower</i> and victim of Miles
Standish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I look,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;like the son of a
sea-cook, even in the sixth generation?&#8221;</p>

<p>And, indeed, he did not resemble a descendant of
the caboose, but rather a marquis of the &Eacute;migration,
such as we behold him at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais.
This somewhat faded <i>&eacute;l&eacute;gant</i> had another passion:
it was for his lovely daughter; nor was he the only
man thus affected.</p>

<p>Mrs. Waddie was wifely, motherly, and a little
over-energetic, as became the spouse of so mild
and unpractical a gentleman. It was she who devised
and carried out that purchase of real estate by
which their comfortable property became a handsome
fortune. It was she who officered the campaign
which ended in giving him the civic crown of
Member of Congress, and when the bad cookery of
the American snob&#8217;s paradise had impaired his
health and compelled his resignation, it was again
his energetic wife who suggested to General Taylor
that she wished the embassy to Florence. It was obtained,
of course, and was one of the most creditable
acts of that President&#8217;s brief career. His successor
did not venture to recall Mr. Waddie, although he
knew the scorn with which that gentleman, usually
so amiable, regarded those ridiculously unsuccessful
makeshifts and cowardly compromises of 1850.
Mr. Waddie&#8217;s fortune, high social position, formidable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
wife, his serene worth and merited popularity,
made him a person whom an accidental President
could not presume to offend; and if he were already
an enemy, at least it were wiser to keep him
in a foreign land.</p>

<p>So his wife and the ambassador remained at
Florence, where her balls crushed the Grand Duke&#8217;s.
She instituted a subscription for fronting the Duomo
and introduced into Florentine life Buckwheat
Cakes, Veracity, and Sewing Machines&mdash;of which
only the first-named are still popular in that beautiful
city.</p>

<p>It was the last year of the embassy when they
thought proper to send for Miss Clara, who, with
Diana, Mr. Waddie&#8217;s ward, had been in charge of
Miss Sullivan at home. This was the first year of
Mr. Pierce&#8217;s administration, and while he was hesitating
whom to appoint in Mr. Waddie&#8217;s place. He
did appoint, in time, a tobacconist from the South-west,
who viewed the world only as a spittoon.</p>

<p>Everybody has been in Florence or will go. It
is not necessary, therefore, here to describe what
Clara and Diana saw under the superintendence
of Miss Sullivan, instinctive discoverer of the best.
They were devout beneath the dome of Brunelleschi,
rapt beside the tower of Giotto, critical in the galleries,
gay in the Cascine. The Florentines adored
Clara, the fair. Strangers worshipped Diana, the
dark. This was not Diana, pale queen of night, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the huntress deity, bold and clear of eye, of colours
rich and warm, with vigorous, fiery blood, hastening,
almost fevering, a living life of passionateness. An
Amazonian queen was Diana, who could do the dashing
deeds of an Amazon with fanciful freedom. The
Act&aelig;ons dreaded her. No man of feeble manhood
was permitted in her presence. Soldierly men and
travellers she liked, and deep-sea fishermen, and
blacksmiths and architects and heroes and lyric poets.
And when any of these told her of his ambitions,
large as life, or the dangers he had passed, and while
he told, looked in her unblenching eyes and saw
through them a soul that could comprehend any
great ambition, or dare any danger; he, the strong
man, always loved her madly. But she, the strong
woman, the master-hero of her own soul, could not
find her hero. There were ideal men in history for
her to adore&mdash;at least, they seemed so, as history
painted them&mdash;and as she read of them, she felt
that strange thrill of despair for their absence that
later she knew to be the passion of love&mdash;the passion
of the woman longing for the fit, appointed
mate.</p>

<p>The friendship of Clara and Diana was fore-ordained.
Its historic beginning dates back to the
college intimacy between young Waddie, refined,
timid, studious, and Diana&#8217;s father, a bold and
ardent youth of southern blood and foreign race.
This gentleman, being afterward unhappy in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
home, wandered away into Texas. There he acquired
immense estates by the purchase of old
Spanish grants, and dying early, bequeathed his
only child to his friend, Mr. Waddie, for care and
nurture. The two girls grew up as sisters, and it
was not until Diana&#8217;s womanhood that the serious
consideration of her orphanage was forced upon her.
Mrs. Waddie, the kindest of mothers, was immersed
in business, speculating for her husband, urging him
forward to posts of responsibility he shrank from.
She was therefore ready to yield her two daughters
entirely into the hands of Miss Sullivan.</p>

<p>It was to Miss Sullivan that the task fell of telling
Diana the sad history of her father and her
mother, and how the mother, after a life worse than
death, was now in a madhouse. It was a terrible
revelation for this pure and brave young girl. In an
agony of tears, she threw herself into Miss Sullivan&#8217;s
arms and prayed her to be a mother to the orphan.
Miss Sullivan must have been of a nature
singularly sympathetic, or herself have felt the loneliness
of bitter grief, so deeply did she know the
only consolations&mdash;endurance, and long-suffering
faith, and hope in other lives, eternal ones.</p>

<p>Clara was present at this interview, and, after
this, the relations between the elder and the younger
women were closely sisterly. The elder sister,
hardly older in appearance, except of paler and more
thoughtful beauty, formed the younger minds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>Clara Waddie had inherited all her father&#8217;s grace
and refinement of face, form, mien, manner, and
thought, and withal had gained from her mother
judgment and strength of character, which underlay
without diminishing her delicate sweetness.
You might have known this fair young person for
months and have given only a mental assent to her
reputation of exquisite beauty; but one day, when
some changing charm of emotion cast an evanescent
flush upon her cheek and your sudden inspiration of
eloquence had roused a look of interest in her lambent
listening eyes, you would become conscious of
more than mental assent to her unclaimed claim of
perfect loveliness; your soul itself would thenceforth
be cognisant of her beauty.</p>

<p>At the end of that delightful year in Florence,
now rich with memories of the art and poetry of
Italy, Diana was suddenly summoned to America.
A most favourable change had come over her
mother&#8217;s malady, and with sanity returning, she was
praying for kindly companionship and love. Her
life, at best, was to be but brief, but it was thought
that a residence in the dry, elevated regions of the
interior might prolong it and allay the pangs of her
desperate disease. Diana did not hesitate; she saw
her duty clearly and accepted it, rejoicing.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddie went over with Diana. She found
a mother with the saddened relics of a feeble beauty.
Married hastily, out of silly school, she had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
ignorantly, in her husband&#8217;s absence, bewildered in
the toils of a great villainy, which death to the
villain and madness to the victim had sufficiently
avenged. Rejecting Mr. Waddie&#8217;s kind offer of escort,
Diana took her mother to their estates in the
up-country of Texas. In that most beautiful region,
the Amazon could carry out her huntress fancies.
She could gallop with her Mexican master of the
horse over vast reaches of prairie, all her own. She
could encamp in those belts of timber that sweep
like rivers across boundless plains of Western wildness.
At noon, when the deer she chased were hid
in forest court, she, too, could seek such sylvan
shelter, and lying there beneath an oak, all grey with
mossy drapery, could take delight of dreamy contrast,
and, with closed eyes, narrow her horizon with
remembered palaces and rebuild under broad blue
heavens the wonderful domes of Italy. Then she
would study in some shady pool of the forest her
face nut-browned to warm and healthy hues and
fancy Clara, more palely beautiful, suddenly appearing,
like Una from the ancient grove, and standing
beside her at this softening mirror, as they had
often stood in loving sisterhood before. In this existence,
free and fresh, she learnt what so few
women ever know, the pure physical joy of living.</p>

<p>The Texas postmaster was puzzled with strange
stamps on Diana&#8217;s constant letters from Europe; she
was as constant in her replies. At last, she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
sadly to tell her friend how her mother, after a sudden
and fearful access of madness, had died. If
there were any circumstances accompanying this
death that made it doubly painful, and if, far away
from the civilisation of towns, she had made other
friends from whom this death was the cause of bitter
parting, of this she said nothing to Clara. There are
some secrets which honourable women do not impart
to anyone more distant from their hearts than
God. As to Endymion, it was certainly not probable
that she had found him among Santa F&eacute;
traders, or Dutch emigrants, or rude cattle drovers
whose best hope was a week of debauch in San
Antonio.</p>

<p>She rejoined the Waddies and they did Europe.
Mankind stared, and jealous women scoffed wherever
Clara and Diana, charming pair, were seen.
Diana was in mourning and very sad&mdash;sadder than
seemed wholly natural for her mother&#8217;s relieving
death. The only gentleman to whom she allowed
any intimacy was Belden. She told Miss Sullivan
that she distrusted him and was displeased with the
little she heard of his deeds, but that he was a bad
imitation of an old friend of hers and she liked to be
reminded of a favourite, even by a poor copy. I
think upon this there must have been some very close
confidence between these ladies; there certainly was
a long interview, with tearfulness.</p>

<p>Are the Waddies of New York sufficiently introduced?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
We certainly know them better historically
than Major Granby could, when, presented by
Ambient, he had passed his first afternoon in their
society. Not so well personally; one look of a practised
eye discovers more than all description or all
history can reveal.</p>

<p>Granby was a wide-worldling of the best type,
and the ladies and Mr. Waddie found him charming.
Sir Com Ambient, that pleasant pinkling of hesitant
utterance, was also a favourite; indeed, Diana
had quite petted him on the voyage, for she liked
travellers, even verdant ones. Freshmen, when they
are honest and ardent, are pleasant to meet. So she
had petted him&mdash;poor Sir Com! He was not at all
blas&eacute;, a fresh and susceptible youth; and of course he
lost his heart utterly.</p>

<p>Granby spoke of his friend Ira. Mr. Ambassador
Waddie had heard of this gentleman; in fact,
who had not?</p>

<p>&#8220;We suppose Mr. Ira Waddy to belong to a
younger branch of our somewhat ancient family,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;Indeed, I have already written him
to inquire our relationship. We shall be happy to
meet him as a kinsman and as a friend of Major
Granby.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young ladies were interested in the major&#8217;s
account of his friend. He was not, Granby said, a
misogynist, though he always avoided women if
he could. He was a cynic of the kindest heart. Utterly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
careless of money, but possessed of a Pactolian
genius for making it, he dashed at a speculation as a
desperate man rides through a front of opposing
battle. It seemed that he valued success so little
that the Fates were willing to give it him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Diana, &#8220;the Fates took an antecedent
revenge. Perhaps they are lavishly compensating
him with what he does not value for the
fatal loss of what he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granby looked hard at her, studying the hieroglyphs
of her expressive face. What experience had
this young person had, enabling her to divine such
secrets of his own life and what he had divined in
his friend&#8217;s history? A sham Champollion would
have given his interpretation that she was generalising
from some disappointment of the wrong man
and not the right one having offered her a bouquet.
Granby, looking deeper, perceived that to this
maiden, whom the gods loved, they had given some
early sorrow, which she was endeavouring to explain
to herself.</p>

<p>Granby went on with the character of Mr. Waddy.
He was a man who concerned himself not much with
books. Having his own thoughts, he did not hungrily
need those of other men. He could exhaust
the books by a question or two from those who took
the trouble to read them. But if generally not a
believer in the works of men or the words of
women, he was a child of nature.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>&#8220;During the long and excursive pilgrimage from
India to London,&#8221; explained Granby, &#8220;which we
have made together, there is hardly one oddity, one
beauty, one fact or phenomenon in nature, not human,
that we have not investigated. We&#8217;ve shot
and bagged everything; we&#8217;ve fished and fished up
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, the major, who liked to talk&mdash;and who
does not?&mdash;to beautiful women, told them snake
stories and tales of crocodiles, and how, in the primary
sense, he and his friend had seen the elephant
and fought the tiger. Then he passed to the Crimean
campaign, where Mr. Waddy had joined him and
gone about recklessly to see the fun of fighting and
relieve its after agony. On the side of fun, there
was a story how Mr. Waddy and Chin Chin had surrounded
a picket-guard of a Russian officer and
four men and brought them in prisoners at the point
of their own bayonets&mdash;a pardonable violation of
the neutrality laws. On the other side, was the account
of Major Granby&#8217;s own rescue by his friend.
Granby told this last with an enthusiasm that
showed the earnestness of his friendship.</p>

<p>The two girls, who would have given up life or a
lover, one for the other, felt a romantic interest in
the alliance of these men, both apparently isolated,
and erratic for some good cause from tranquil happiness.
Diana&#8217;s interest was that of a comrade in
these adventures; Clara&#8217;s was an almost timorous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
sympathy. Ambient listened and blushed pinker
with excitement. He was a little cut out by a man
who had done what he only hoped to do; but Sir
Com was a good fellow, and while the first fiddle
played, he put up his pipe of tender wild oat in its
verdant case and applauded the solo heartily.</p>

<p>By Mr. Waddie&#8217;s invitation, Granby and Ambient
joined his party at the Tremont House. The
ladies also suggested Newport, whither they were
all going. Granby mentioned his half-engagement
with Mr. Waddy to drop in at that watering-place
on their tour, and said that the pleasure of their society,
etc., etc. In short, if he could persuade his
friend, they would drop in, and &#8220;we&#8217;ll give you a
plunge, too, Ambient,&#8221; he promised.</p>

<p>This conversation took place at the breakfast
table, the morning after they landed. The ladies
presently disappeared and, when they reappeared,
were resplendent with results of unpacking. The
proud and brilliant Diana was still in half-mourning.
I think this Amazon must have beheld Clara&#8217;s
loveliness with almost masculine admiration and
have expressed it with manly compliments, for Clara
seemed a little conscious as they stepped into a carriage,
not quick enough to avoid the two gentlemen.
These knightly squires were eager for a glimpse at
brightened beauty. Granby assumed the privilege of
handing them into their go-cart, while the humbler
Ambient defended skirt from wheel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>&#8220;We are going,&#8221; said Diana, &#8220;to pass the morning
with our friend, Miss Sullivan, in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adieu the eagle and the swan!&#8221; cried Granby,
as they drove off. &#8220;By Imperial Jove! Ambient,
she is worthy to be the consort of a god. If I was
ambitious, as you are, I should aspire as you do and
as much in vain. I suppose this is your first love, eh?
You&#8217;re luckier than most men. A man&#8217;s first is
generally either a grandmotherly old flirt become
<i>d&eacute;vote</i>, or some bread-and-butter, sweet simplicity,&mdash;oh,
bah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky!&#8221; echoed Ambient. &#8220;I&#8217;m confoundedly
unlucky and unhappy. She&#8217;ll never have anything
to say to me&mdash;except in that infernal condescending
<i>de haut en bas</i> style, as if I was a boy. I&#8217;d like to
pwove it on somebody that I&#8217;m not!&#8221; and Sir Com
looked around with a quite fierce expression upon
his pleasant countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not at all sorry for you,&#8221; said Granby
cheerfully. &#8220;It never does anyone any harm to be
desperately in love with a woman who is worthy.
You may be sure that Diana will never flirt with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She fluriot!&mdash;she would never care enough for
anyone&#8217;s admiration to twy to gain it. I only wish
she would fluriot with me; then I could be angwy&mdash;now
I&#8217;m only wetched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not help you to know that everybody must
go through it,&#8221; said Granby, his face grave again&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
a little bitter. &#8220;I have, my dear fellow&mdash;and
worse. For my part, I admire the goddess immensely;
but I think I could love her friend more&mdash;that
heavenly mildness gently soothes my soul. The
nose,&#8221; continued the major, waxing eloquent, &#8220;is
man&#8217;s most available feature&mdash;it may be tweaked.
The mouth in woman is delicately expressive and
available when we are allowed to&#8221;&mdash;and he raised
his fingers with courteous reverence to his lips.
&#8220;But the mouth is external merely. Who wishes to
look down it, even though heart may be in throat
and panting at the parted lips? It is the eyes&mdash;eyes
like Clara&#8217;s, where there is soul beneath the surface
and down in the deep profound of those wells of
lightsome lustre is truth&mdash;these we may dreamily
gaze in for life-long peacefulness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ambient stared at this rhapsody, not quite certain
whether his companion was in earnest. But before
he could decide, a carriage drove up, and Granby
gave a distant view-halloo as Mr. Waddy stepped
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Punctual to a tick,&#8221; said Ira, holding up his
watch and producing the rhinoceros-horn match-box
and his case of cheroots.</p>

<p>Granby took one, presented Sir Com, and they entered
the hotel together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Horace Belden was out that morning exercising
his race-horse Knockknees. As he descended the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
same slope where he had fouled with Tootler&#8217;s
buggy, he saw approaching a carriage with two ladies.
He recognised them instantly, with a leap of
the heart. He drew up by their side with polite commonplaces
of welcome, dashed with more meaning
when he addressed Diana. They told him whence
and whither&mdash;to-day to Miss Sullivan, to-morrow
to Newport.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you like that man?&#8221; asked Clara, as
they drove on. &#8220;He seems to me a Sansfoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not like or trust him,&#8221; replied Diana. &#8220;I
tolerate him because he rides well and is agreeable,
and because he reminds me of an old friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stooped to pick up a broken-winged butterfly
that had fluttered feebly into the carriage. Stooping
sent the blood into her face. While they cherished
the poor insect, she grew of a sudden deadly
pale, and putting her hand to her side, shuddered
slightly. Clara did not observe the motion, which
was not repeated.</p>

<p>There is no need to describe the meeting between
pupils and preceptress; but in the late twilight Clara
returned without Diana, who had consented to stay
a day or two with Miss Sullivan. She wished to
keep both the friends, but Mrs. Waddie would need
her daughter in arranging their house.</p>

<p>Mr. Ira Waddy lionised Boston with Granby and
Ambient. They looked in for a moment on Mr.
Tootler. He was composing an air to a Fr&eacute;mont<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
song which he had just written, and which Mrs.
Tootler would revise&mdash;and perhaps infuse with even
sharper ginger. He played it for them on the flute.
Sir Com listened with astonishment. Mr. Tootler
figures in the chapter entitled, &#8220;An Hour with a
Musical Wool-Merchant,&#8221; in that young gentleman&#8217;s
book, &#8220;Pork and Beans; or, Tracks in the Trail of
the Bear and the Buffalo.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the evening, Waddy and Waddie became acquainted.
The ambassador accepted the relationship,
which was now fully established by relics and
traditions. The Great Tradition, however, of the
<i>Mayflower</i>, the caboose, Miles Standish, the pepper-pot&mdash;this
he laughed at as legendary. Ira clung to it
vigorously; he liked to have come in with the Pilgrims,
even at the expense of humble ancestry and
an inherited curse.</p>

<p>The serene Waddie, whose life was happy gentleness,
whose toil had been done for him by fortune
and by feminine energy, had no occasion to look to
the past for causes of present exasperating characteristics.
He had inherited the family mildness, and
though he decorated his social station, he was not
one to have assumed it. He acknowledged his obligations
to his wife. He had thus ignorantly fulfilled
the destiny of his race.</p>

<p>Clara gave the legend her full adhesion; but nothing
was said in this conclave of the Tory sutler, or
the Revolutionary sergeant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>Diana was missed, but the name of her hostess
was not mentioned. There was no reason why Miss
Sullivan should be talked of among strangers; no
one knew of that incident of Mr. Waddy&#8217;s Return
where she had appeared and played so important a
part, nor that he would be pleased to see and thank
his preserver.</p>

<p>In the morning, the whole party went to Newport.
Thither all the actors of our drama are centering.
It is strange by what delicate links of influence
life is bound to life&mdash;what chances of seemingly
casual meetings and partings determine history!</p>

<p>Pallid went with his master; also a fast pair that
Tootler had purchased for Mr. Waddy, who meant
to be both charioteer and cavalier.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<span class="small">PROTECTIVE SCANDALS AND OTHER DIVERTING HUMOURS<br />
OF A FASHIONABLE WATERING-PLACE</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONCE upon a time, by a chance of history, a
small man was thrust into greatness of place.</p>

<p>Moulded in putty for a niche, he tottered and
crumbled on a pedestal.</p>

<p>This pedestalled weakling, small in his great
place, prayed for support. He got it on conditions&mdash;rather
shabby ones. He was to acknowledge himself
frightened, his niche in life a mistake. He was to
deny his old views of right, and compromise away
right for a novel view of ancient wrong.</p>

<p>When time came that he should remove, he was
willing to stay and be a dough image in a high
place; but a grateful people of a grateful republic
did not invite him.</p>

<p>At another time, a grateful people rather scornfully
declined him a re-invitation to the old place,
though he prayed it in suppliant guise.</p>

<p>But a grateful people did as much as could be expected;
they built a great hotel at Newport and
named it by his name. It still lives, and its name is
&#8220;The Millard.&#8221;</p>

<p>What they call the odour of respectability that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
hangs about an old institution is not always fragrance
when that institution is a hotel. There, most
people prefer the odour of new paint. So it was
with our dramatis person&aelig;. They chose the Millard,
not from sympathy with its name, but with its
newness.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy preferred going with Granby and
Ambient, whom they had adopted, to abandoning
these friends and accepting the invitation of his
ambassador kinsman. So these three gentlemen
inscribed themselves upon the books of the Millard.</p>

<p>Miss Arabella Budlong had just returned from
her bath. She was in the hair and costume of La
Sonnambula in the bridge scene, and it was a little
dangerous, her rush to the window to inspect the
companions of Mr. Waddy. She might have been
seen&mdash;in fact, she was seen, but not recognised, by
Peter Skerrett, who had arrived that morning. He
called Gyas Cutus and told him to look at Venus
Anadyomene, drying herself in the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna who?&#8221; asked Gyas. &#8220;That&#8217;s Belle Bud.
She&#8217;s always drying at this hour, and I believe
doesn&#8217;t care who knows it. I say, Peter, who
are those chaps just come in? You know everybody
before he is born. A very neat lot they
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That brown one with the cheroot is Ira Waddy,&#8221;
replied Peter, &#8220;the partner of the great East Indian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
banker, Jimsitchy Jibbybohoy. The big man is the
Grand Duke Constantine, come over to study our institutions,
republican and peculiar, with a view to
the emancipation of serfs. Number three is the
eldest hope of the Pope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaaz!&#8221; said Gyas, with indescribable intonation.
&#8220;The Pope don&#8217;t have eldest sons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would be willing to have him the old gentleman&#8217;s
youngest to please you,&#8221; replied Peter, &#8220;but
historic truth is a grave thing. Apropos of boots
and kicking, I significantly advise you not to call
that young lady Belle Bud any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Misses Julia Wilkes and Milly Center were in the
Millard parlour with Cloanthus Fortisque and Billy
Dulger. They saw the stranger gentlemen arrive,
and Milly felt her <i>volage</i> little heart expand toward
Ambient, that rosebud of Albion. She had a lively
imagination for flirtations and immediately built an
ideal vista with a finale of a kneeling scene, Ambient,
in tears, offering his heart and a dukedom.
She was not quite decided whether to raise him from
his entrancement by a tap of fan, as wand, or to
leave him in that comical position and call in a
friend to witness her disdained triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, Mr. Dulger,&#8221; said Milly, with the despotism
of a miss in her position, &#8220;and find out who they are&mdash;particularly
that handsome young man in the curious
coat, lovely complexion, and mutton-chops.
He looks so sweet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>Poor Dulger, compelled to prepare the way for a
possible rival, went off savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make her pay for all this sometime,&#8221; he murmured,
with clenched fists.</p>

<p>Dulger was fast getting desperate. He had been
with this young fair one a centripetal dangler or
gyroscope for years. Milly had taken his bouquets
all her winters, without regard to expense. But
other bouquets she had likewise taken, to the dismay
of his faithful heart. When cleverer men, or bigger
men, or men with more regular features or less
sporadic moustache, came, yielding to Miss Milly&#8217;s
seducing attentions,&mdash;and she was not chary of
them,&mdash;poor Dulger sat in the background, looking
at his tightish new boots, and bit his thumb at these
cleverer, bigger, handsomer. He could not understand
the world-wide discursiveness of the clever
men, nor in truth, did Milly, but she had tact enough
to see when her locutor thought he had said a witty
thing, and then she could give a pretty laugh; or
when it was a poetical, sentimental thing, she could
look down and softly sigh. A man must have flattery
for his vanity as much as sugar for his coffee,
and Milly was very liberal of that sweet condiment.
Her charm lasted with the clever men days, weeks,
months, according to their necessities for unintelligent
flattering sympathy and the frequency of their
interviews.</p>

<p>Billy Dulger had seen so many generations of such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
lovers come and go, more or less voluntarily, that he
began to feel a pre-emptive, prescriptive, or squatter
sovereign right to the premises; for there were premises,
as well as a person&mdash;a house where one might
willingly hang his hat. Miss Milly was an orphan
and had a house&mdash;nay, many houses&mdash;of her own.
Her lover was proceeding in the established manner
of courtship by regular approaches and steady
siege. It generally succeeds, this method, and is,
after all, easier to the dangling man of no genius and
safer than the bold assault of a hardy forlorn hope.
So many campaigns&mdash;such constant cannonade of
bouquets with great occasional bombardment of
flower-baskets&mdash;missives proposing truce&mdash;shams of
raising the siege&mdash;showers of Congreve rockets in
the form of cornucopias of bonbons&mdash;parleys of no
actual consequence effected by sympathising allies&mdash;cautious
spying with lorgnette, followed by assault
upon opera box&mdash;watchful pouncings when the garrison
sallies forth for stores&mdash;patience, pertinacity,
and final success: this was Mr. Dulger&#8217;s game. It
was, however, no sport to him. It cannot be sweet
for a man to be forever in the presence of a woman
he loves or wants, he playing the triangle while a
<i>gran&#8217; maestro</i> is leading at the apex of the orchestra.
He cannot enjoy hearing her applaud another man
for saying things he cannot possibly think of and
does not quite understand. Billy, therefore, was not
happy in his courtship. He knew his love was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
flirt, and not particularly charming, except that she
made a business of being so. But it had become with
him a vice to love her, if such is love. Should he
ever succeed, after his ages of suspensory dangling,
he will not be brilliantly happy. This is experience
which he will remember, and though a well-enough
intentioned man, he will necessarily avenge with
marital severities his ante-nuptial pains.</p>

<p>Have we dallied too long with Miss Milly and
Master William? They are essentials in this history,
and, though casually as it would seem, yet on
them depends its event.</p>

<p>As Mr. Waddy turned after booking himself at the
Millard, he found his hand suddenly seized by Mr.
De Flournoy Budlong. The bloom on this gentleman&#8217;s
cheeks had jaundiced to autumnal hues. His
smooth, round, jolly face had shrunken and was
veined with dry wrinkles like a frozen apple. Poor
Bud, flowering no longer, seediness was overcoming
him, to no one&#8217;s special wonder who saw the principal
female of his family conducting herself very
much indeed, and watched young Tim subscribing
every night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you&#8217;ve come,&#8221; said Budlong, with unhappy
cordiality. &#8220;I got here this morning. Peter Skerrett
said it was time for me to be on hand and gave
me half his stateroom. Seasick all night; yes, sir,
every minute. Peter says juicy men always are.
Deuced rough off P&#8217;int Judith. Peter said it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the story in the Apocalypse, Judith, and whole infernos.
Found Tim with his head very much
swelled. Bad cold, he said. I told him he&#8217;d better
stay in bed. He said he would till evening&mdash;had a
small subscription party at nine. Asked him to take
me&mdash;he said strangers had to be balloted for once
a week for three weeks. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s all poppycock.
Mrs. B. has gone out to walk with that blasted
Frenchman. Ah, here she comes now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Budlong entered with Auguste Henri. She
dismissed her escort with a whisper and walked up
to her husband, very handsome, very well dressed,
perfectly at her ease, and gave him two fingers of
the hand which held her parasol.</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do, pa?&#8221; said she. &#8220;You&#8217;ve left us to
take care of ourselves so long that we thought you&#8217;d
forgotten us. I&#8217;m sorry you didn&#8217;t let me know you
were coming; you could have brought up another
horse instead of Drummer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened to him? He&#8217;s my best horse,&#8221;
said the husband thus tenderly received as master
of the cavalry.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant was riding him, and that rude
young Dunstan, driving the Wellabouts, ran into
him. Drummer was badly cut and Aug&mdash;De
Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant had his&mdash;his clothes torn. He intends
to punish Dunstan, who was very insolent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he will,&#8221; said De Flournoy, rubbing his
hands and brightening up. &#8220;I should like to see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
beggar well thrashed&#8221;&mdash;of course it was Dunstan
he meant.</p>

<p>Mrs. De Flournoy had been quite conscious of
Waddy&#8217;s presence during this colloquy. Waddy
was a man whom she was willing to propitiate. She
had even tried her fascinations on him early in the
voyage&mdash;merely in the way of a flirtation, of course.
But Ira was loyal, though not pretending to be a
saint, and remained impervious to the darts which
Mrs. B. shot at him from her expressive eyes. To
Ira, therefore, Mrs. B. now turned, bowed gracefully
and smiled pleasantly. She had the spoiling of
a very fine woman in her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were sorry to be deprived of your society on
board,&#8221; said she, with easy suavity, &#8220;even for so
heroic a reason. We were hardly willing to speak
to Mr. Tim Budlong after his abandoning you. But
he is so aristocratic. He said he thought the little
beggar might as well drown. We, of course, did not
think so. I hope to see you often while you are here.
We will study American society together. One of
the charms of hotel life is that we can see our friends
so constantly and familiarly and form agreeable intimacies.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this was said in Mrs. De Flournoy&#8217;s most
gracious manner to Mr. Waddy, and at him and his
friends. She was determined to make a good impression&mdash;excessively
determined, unfortunately.
She wished to signalise her first summer after Europe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
by great social triumphs and courted everybody,
except those whom she could venture to contemn.
Still, men at a watering-place are not disposed to reject
the advances of pretty women, and Waddy
would have been placable, but that he did not care
for intimacy with a person who could accept De
Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant as <i>cicisbeo</i>, or even acquaintance. He
could not forget signs of a complete understanding
he had detected between him and the lady. However,
Waddy said the civil nothings and Mrs. Budlong
went upstairs, followed humbly by poor old
Bud.</p>

<p>Peter Skerrett calls the stair at the Millard
&#8220;Jacob&#8217;s Ladder,&#8221; because, says he, &#8220;the angels who
have good tops to their ankles are continually ascending
and descending.&#8221; Up Jacob&#8217;s Ladder, then,
Mr. Waddy and his friends presently marched to
their rooms.</p>

<p>When the trio, after their toilet, descended, they
found the hall lined with people awaiting dinner.
Peter Skerrett stepped up to greet Mr. Waddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Peter,&#8221; said the young nabob, introducing
his friends, &#8220;sit down and tell us what you call
the protective scandals. We are all green at Newport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a new expwession to me,&#8221; said Sir Com,
gaspingly as usual. &#8220;Pwotective scandals&mdash;what
does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strangers,&#8221; explained Peter oracularly, &#8220;before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
they are up to trap, are apt to put their foot in
it. They need someone to inform them who are
the people they must know, whom they may know,
whom they may know under penalties, and whom
they must not know. They need also a general guide
to conversation&mdash;to know to whom they shall say,
&#8216;Man is the architect of his own fortunes,&#8217; and to
whom, &#8216;It is a noble thing to be descended from a
long line of proud and noble ancestors.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must we learn the pedigwee of evewybody
here?&#8221; demanded Ambient, in consternation. &#8220;I
shall have to cwam like a fellow going up for his
gweat go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there you&#8217;ve hit it,&#8221; replied Peter. &#8220;The
actual pedigrees are almost none, thanks to republican
institutions. Except a very few families, who
have managed to hold together and keep pelf to their
names, there are no pedigrees to remember. As a
Nation, we have buried our grandfather. Parentage
only of everyone is what you must know. We
are a religious people,&#8221; and he turned his eyes upward
whither the ceiling was between him and
heaven, and motioned as if to cross himself. &#8220;Yes,
fervently religious, and have read in Holy Writ that
labour was a curse. We have agreed that it ought
to be expunged. But as it is almost impossible in
general powwow to avoid alluding to some trade or
business, the great protective scandal is to know the
individual one not to mention to each of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
people. They do not wish to be reminded by what
especial class of curse their papas were made miserable
and millionaire.</p>

<p>&#8220;For example,&#8221; continued Peter, delighted to
have the floor and so select an audience, &#8220;that rather
long girl, walking with a race-horse stride, is Miss
Peytona Fashion. Her parent began his fortune by
betting against his own horse. It would be deemed
uncivil if you, Sir Comeguys, should stand before
her, and with a whiff at her circumambient atmosphere
of odours, should ask her if her favourite perfume
was Jockey Club.</p>

<p>&#8220;So there is hardly one subject that is not taboo
with someone. Mrs. De Flournoy Budlong loves
not to hear of flowery meads or breakfast called a
meal&mdash;it seems to let the cat out the bag. Old Flirney,
you know, began as a deck-hand on a barrel-barge,
and has, turned to the wall in a lock-up in his
garret, a portrait of himself shouldering a cask of
flour; that portrait is her closet skeleton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see you have spotted the Southern belle,&#8221;
added he to Ambient, who was gazing at a dark,
luxurious beauty opposite him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spotted her!&#8221; echoed the youth, blushing
pinkly. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do it for the wowuld.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean remarked her. You&#8217;ll learn the language
by-and-by. You&#8217;re looking at her foot&mdash;that&#8217;s
the pretty one; the other&#8217;s enlarged in the
joint by dancing. Well, that is Miss Saccharissa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Mellasys, the creole belle from Louisiana. You&#8217;re
an abolitionist, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Englishman: &#8220;isn&#8217;t evewyone
who has no pecuniawy intewest in slavewy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Peter, &#8220;more or less so.
But beware of talking anti-slavery to Miss Mellasys.
You&#8217;ll bring an unhandsome look into those
tranquil eyes. She&#8217;s here on the proceeds of one of
her half-sisters. Success of abolitionism would
knock off her summer trips to civilisation, and she
knows that her amiable papa wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to
sell her, as he does the scions of his dusky brood,
without too much inquiry as to the purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You call this a democratic republic, I believe,&#8221;
said Granby.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the land of the free and the home of the
brave!&#8221; cried Peter, waving his hat. &#8220;Pardon this
ebullition of national pride. I&#8217;m getting up my enthusiasm
for a presidential stumping tour this fall.
Well, Saccharissa is very pretty. I&#8217;m told they cultivate
that startled expression of the eyes at the
South by placing the girls, when they&#8217;re infants, on
the edge of a bayou; the alligators come and snap
at them, but the nurse runs them off just in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you allow me to make a note of that custom?&#8221;
asked Ambient, who had listened open-mouthed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; assented Peter graciously, &#8220;and I
can tell you more of the same sort, if you wish,&#8221; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the sound of the dinner-gong prevented further recitals.</p>

<p>Tim Budlong appeared at dinner, all beauteous
with raiment, but looking desperately rou&eacute;. He
had, too, the peculiarly anxious look of an amateur
subscriber, so different from the cautious
carelessness of the professional receiver of subscriptions.</p>

<p>Tim was disposed to dodge Mr. Waddy; but Ira
had no quarrel with the hopeful youth, who had in
the Halifax affair only done as most men do. It is
not worth while, as Mr. Waddy knew, to be permanently
disgusted with human beings for acting according
to their natures; he knew that character is
a compound of blood, breeding, and experience. So
he gave Tim a glass of claret and said &#8220;<i>Pax vobiscum</i>,
my lad!&#8221; very kindly.</p>

<p>Tim, pleased with the patronage of the distinguished
stranger, who, with his two friends, and
Chin Chin behind his chair, was an object of gaze at
the Millard&mdash;Tim, elated by such good society, for
twenty minutes resolved to reform. At the twenty-first
minute, he caught a wink from Gyas Cutus, and
with a knowing crook of the elbow, turned off his
glass of what Millard called champagne and became
a reprobate again.</p>

<p>After dinner, Peter Skerrett was besieged by speculators
for information. &#8220;Who are your friends?&#8221;
was the cry of many a hopeful mother. Peter forgot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
his previous story and now asserted that they were
Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar, the Three Kings
of Cologne. Peter was fond of mystification. But
the hotel books and the Budlongs gave more authentic
accounts. Henceforth patrols of marriageable
daughters were about Ira&#8217;s path; but we shall
regard them no more than did he.</p>

<p>De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant, swaggering up the hall before
dinner, had seen Sir Comeguys. He seemed to
recognise and desire to avoid him, and had kept out
of the way carefully. Miss Arabella was therefore
solitary, as old Bud adhered to his wife, which, perhaps,
accounted for the fact that she was not blossoming
so luxuriantly as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Arabella is not a bad girl,&#8221; remarked Peter
Skerrett to Waddy at dinner. &#8220;The mother&mdash;such
a mother!&mdash;is ruining her, as she has already
spoiled poor Tim. I abhor that woman.&#8221; Peter
was usually very cool and non-committal, but he
grew quite excited at this moment. &#8220;Look now at
her <i>&eacute;talage</i>,&#8221; he continued, referring to her low-neck.
&#8220;What fun it is&mdash;a watering-place! I&#8217;m
so romantic that I have to come here every year for
a week to be taken down. I should positively be
falling in love with women if I didn&#8217;t see them here
occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not stay away and be romantic near cottages
rose-embowered?&#8221; suggested Waddy. &#8220;The
damsels who trim the roses are fresh as they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
pure&mdash;what these others are doesn&#8217;t in the least
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gammon! Pardon me,&#8221; said Peter quickly.
&#8220;That observation was addressed to the waiter&mdash;ham,
I meant. Can a man like myself seek his love
among hollyhocks and marigolds? Really, whatever
I may say, I&#8217;m not quite spoony enough for
female society, except when the band is playing
melting strains of passionate despair from some
Italian opera, and I am far enough distant therefrom
not to observe false notes and brassiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be sentimental now,&#8221; said Waddy,
smiling. &#8220;Who is it? Can it be Miss Arabella? I
am interested there, too, in a godfatherly way. I
will help you to lynch hot nubbless, as Mr. Budlong
calls him. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; said Peter, his cheeks somewhat
unnaturally bright. &#8220;He&#8217;ll take himself off when
he&#8217;s won all he can from Tim and the other boys,
unless he can marry some of the girls&mdash;and then, as
Squire Western says, one would hate like the deuce
to be hanged for such a rascal. I don&#8217;t believe Miss
Arabella would allow him so much about her, if it
were not for her step-mother. I think the infernal
blackleg has the mother in his power and she intends
to sacrifice the daughter to save herself!&#8221; and
Peter took a draught of ice-water, against his better
judgment, for he was growing quite unnaturally
heated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>&#8220;Peter! Peter!&#8221; protested Waddy, &#8220;I&#8217;d be
afraid your imagination had become perverted by
dealing so much with the protective scandals&mdash;but
I&#8217;d come nearly to the same conclusion myself. I
saw too much on board the steamer. I said all I
could to old Bud.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was on account of this conversation that Mr.
Waddy, seeing Miss Arabella alone after dinner,
joined her and chatted a while. Mr. Waddy, though
he allows himself to swear in several distant languages,
and is altogether perfectly independent in
his conduct, will, I hope, already have shown himself
a man of refinement in feeling and manner. Women
have tact enough to adapt themselves to such men
and often humbug them for a time. Miss De Flournoy&#8217;s
altered manner, as she promenaded with Ira,
was not humbug, but the unconscious effect of
gentlemanly influence.</p>

<p>Long absence from Society, so called, had given
Mr. Waddy a large appetite to taste whatever it
might have to offer of nutriment or tidbit. He was
not a gourmand for scandals, nor a gourmet for
gossip. Food is food. Yet grub may not be ambrosia,
and, <i>certes</i>, nectar is not swipes. On the
whole, he remained a-hungered. Ecstasy he was not
expecting; he had outgrown such hope by fifteen
years. Amusement he found. He had banquets
sometimes and sometimes feasts infestive; people
dined him for various reasons; he was made rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
a lion. Peter Skerrett was inexhaustibly amusing.
Under his auspices, Mr. Waddy and his friends came
judiciously to know all the delectable people and all
the desirables not so delectable. When the autocratic
gentlemen at the Nilvedere Hotel expended
fifteen dollars in pink buckram for decorations and
gave a ball, Ira was invited, of course. When soon
after Mr. Belden&#8217;s arrival, that gentleman, after an
unusually successful subscription night, persuaded
Mrs. Aquiline to matronise a picnic, Mr. Waddy
and his friends were of the party. Mr. Belden gave
out publicly that this picnic was for Diana. To
Mrs. De Flournoy Budlong he whispered that
it was in honour of their acquaintance and rapid
intimacy.</p>

<p>Mr. Belden would hardly have been willing that
Diana should know how great this intimacy had
become. She was not likely to hear the scandals of
the Millard; and it is not to be denied that the intimacy
soon became one of the most delectable of
the said scandals. Julia Wilkes and Milly Center
talked it over and knew quite too much about it.
Mrs. Aquiline remembered that she was <i>n&eacute;e</i> Retrouss&eacute;e,
and with a subdued delight kept the rector
of St. Gingulphus fully informed. Rev. Theo.
Logge, who was by this time well into the Lee
Scuppernong, smacked his lips over the flirtation
and hoped to Mrs. Grognon that there was nothing
wrong.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>&#8220;A foo paw,&#8221; he said, &#8220;would bring terrible disgrace
upon the congregation of St. Aspasia.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Logge indited two letters to the <i>Preserver</i>.
The religious letter bewailed the immorality
of the fashionable world, in the pious style of generalisation,
and referred to the &#8220;dreadful developments
in the communication of our secular correspondent,
Phylac Terry.&#8221; Phylac did not develop
anything; he confined himself to liquorish innuendos.</p>

<p>Whenever Mrs. Budlong was out with her
<i>&eacute;talage</i> in the parlours, Mr. Belden might have been
seen hanging over and inspecting it. There was no
hour when they were not together. Belden&#8217;s bolter
came into play for buggy drives at solitary hours,
and though he was willing to conceal the qualities
of that singed cat, Knockknees, he rode him cautiously
by her side on the beach. The sun went
down, dimmer grew the horizon where it met the
sea, dusk and dim and far-away, falling upon the
boundlessness of sea. With the glow and the glory
of sunset, gay files of carriages had left the beach,
struggled over the stones, and climbed the dusty
hill. But Mr. Belden and his companion lingered.
She was saying little and sometimes hardly listening,
thinking perhaps of girlish escapades on
horseback, stampedes upon a bareback pony over
meadow or among the pumpkin piles of her father&#8217;s
orchard long ago,&mdash;ah! how long it seemed!&mdash;when
she was simpler and possibly purer than now.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Purer? Ah! this seemed a thought she was willing
to dismiss, and Drummer suffered for her wish to
fly from it. He tore madly on through the dim
twilight, she looking back almost fearfully. When
that gallop was over, she was again ready to devote
herself to her cavalier, letting him bend over the
saddle and rearrange her dress.</p>

<p>Peter Skerrett did not like this at all and spoke to
Mr. Budlong, who came and went every week. Old
Bud told him that since his wife had frankly given
up the Frenchman, she should have her own way.
He trusted her fully, he said&mdash;good soul!</p>

<p>Peter had no right to interfere. Mr. Waddy had
no right. No one had. No one ever has. Women
and men go on ruining themselves, and the world
winks and lets them.</p>

<p>Nor had Peter any right to interfere in Miss Arabella&#8217;s
flirtation with De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant. He therefore
kept away and the flirtation intensified. Mrs.
Budlong patronised it.</p>

<p>Peter could not interfere in Master Tim&#8217;s subscriptions.
Tim was of age, his father&#8217;s partner.
What if he chose to subscribe? Peter used to drop
in at the subscription rooms and watch the young
rake&#8217;s progress. The principal subscriptions were in
private&mdash;it was then that De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant made
his heaviest collections. He was a most accomplished
and successful collector. It may have been
that he occasionally allowed Tim to get somewhat in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
arrears; it was well enough to have Miss Arabella&#8217;s
brother under obligations.</p>

<p>Peter Skerrett inquired of Rev. Logge whether all
his tract societies were supplied with agents.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could recommend you,&#8221; says Peter, &#8220;a most
surprising beggar who gets money out of everyone,
as Agent for the Society for Making Tracks.&#8221;</p>

<p>In fact, to both Peter and Mr. Waddy, the colour
of the nobleman&#8217;s legs became daily more offensive.
They were usually clad in violet cassimere, with a
flowered stripe, as is the manner of noblemen of his
particular rank. But to the two gentlemen they
seemed dyed of darkest Stygian hues.</p>

<p>Peter Skerrett, to distract himself from these
anxieties, though he denied that he felt any or was
concerned for the Budlongs, otherwise than as an
amateur of scandals, took Sir Comeguys under his
protection. Like a European courier, he would
allow no one to cheat that ingenuous youth but
himself. Thus there is a Skerretty congruity in the
wild legends of American life which luridly light the
pages of &#8220;Tracks in the Trail of the Bear and the
Buffalo.&#8221; Gyas Cutus and Cloanthus, when they
were off duty with Miss Julia Wilkes, were constantly
on the watch for Sir Com. They liked to be
seen with the baronet, and were ardent to &#8220;sell&#8221;
him, as they called it. But these mercantile transactions,
more satisfactory to the seller than to the
sold, Peter Skerrett interfered with.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take care, Guy, you and old Clo,&#8221;
he said, to the pair of pleasant knaves. &#8220;This son
of perfidious Albion may be green, but he is plucky
and you may get your heads punched. That
wouldn&#8217;t do, because they are soft and the indentures
caused by such punching would remain and
make it hard to fit you with hats. Abstain and be
wise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do let us have a shy at him, Peter,&#8221; pleaded
Gyas. &#8220;His ancestors and mine fought at Bunker
Hill&mdash;I wish to revenge the death of General
Warren.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your ancestors?&#8221; replied Peter. &#8220;Who told
you that you ever had any? They may have been
tadpoles or worse at that heroic period. Certainly,
your grandfather, the first human Gyas Cutus I ever
heard of, was only a grade above the tadpole when
he kept the Frog Huddle Pond House, near what
was then the village of Newark in Jersey. We allow
you to associate with us because you&#8217;re not such a
very bad fellow when you&#8217;re properly bullied; but
don&#8217;t try to come the ancestor dodge&mdash;except in that
neat and evidently inherited way you have of mixing
drinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t be too hard on a feller,&#8221; said Guy.
&#8220;Come and make it seven bells&mdash;<i>tomar las once</i>,
as the Dagoes say&mdash;I learned that from a sailor yesterday
aboard of Blinders&#8217; yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re learning to mar all hours with tipple. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
shall have to whisper to the fair Julia, unless you
swear off,&#8221; threatened Peter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear enough, off and on, don&#8217;t I, Clo? But
the tipple tap won&#8217;t stop. I believe I&#8217;ll knock off
everything but bourbon, as you told me to do before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Peter encouragingly. &#8220;The deterioration
in our race is completely checked since native
wines and bourbon came in. Take plenty of bourbon,
and if you ever have a son, possibly he may
have a beard. Think of that!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<span class="small">MR. WADDY RECEIVES A LETTER AND GETS OUT HIS<br />
PISTOLS</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was about this time that Mr. Waddy received
the following letter from Mr. Tootler:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">The Shrine</span>, August, 1855.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Ira:</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I have leased your store, No. 26 Waddy Buildings,
to Godfrey Bullion &amp; Co., for five years at
$5000 a year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wool is up and fleecing prospers. I am glad, for
Mrs. T. asked me the other day what I thought had
better be the name of our boy. How would you like
to be N. or M. to him&mdash;Ira if it&#8217;s he, Irene if it&#8217;s a
girl? Ira and Irene&mdash;Wrath and Peace&mdash;that&#8217;s just
the difference between boy and girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is not what I am writing about. You
know, my dear old boy, that I was never inquisitive
about your affairs. Still, you can&#8217;t suppose that I
have not divined something with regard to you and
a certain old friend of ours. I don&#8217;t ask information
now, because I believe if you had the right, you
would have given it long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you remember Sally Bishop. The day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
after you bought Pallid, Cecilia went over to see
her. (The dear girl is always going to see people that
have diseases. I wonder she don&#8217;t take the smallpox
and yellow fever twice a month the year round.)
It seems old Bishop had spoken of you, and when
my wife arrived, Sally, who is dying fast, was very
curious to hear more. Cecilia was surprised to find
that Sally knew you, but would have supposed her
inquiries only the ordinary interest of a neighbour
in the return of a neighbour, except for something
very singular in her manner. Sally asked if you
were as fine-looking as ever. Mrs. T., of course,
gave the proper reply. Were you married? Did
you look happy? Cecilia thought it a strange question&mdash;but
said that though you were cheerful and
very amusing, she found you sometimes very sad&mdash;she
had observed, in fact, as I had, that there seemed
to be some unhappiness at the bottom of your indifferent
manner. Sally Bishop burst into tears, in
such a distressed and almost agonised manner that
my wife feared she would kill herself with weeping.
Cecilia prayed her to say what this meant, and she
answered in a frightened voice, &#8216;Remorse!&#8217;&mdash;she
would not or could not say anything more, and has
always refused to see Cecilia since.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have good reason to suppose that Sally had at
one time the most intimate relations with Belden.
She may have been his mistress. I only much suspect,
without being able to fully prove. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
child, a <i>filius nullius</i>, who died, and it was the feeling
of shame at this, though I believe that not five
people knew it, that drove her father to hard
drinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ira&mdash;what cause can she have to feel remorse
at the mention of your name? Is it possible
that she may have been drawn by Belden into some
devilish plot against you? And against someone
else?</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make no conjectures, as I do not know
facts enough. Cecilia, who seems to have her own
theory, which she will not impart, will endeavour to
learn more from Sally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meantime, do you watch Belden! I know that
he went several times to see Sally, and each time she
was more ill. He is capable of anything, the rotten
villain!&mdash;as two of my family know, Cecilia and
myself. Is he disposed to be friendly with you now?
Something may appear in conversation, if you have
a clew. Watch him!</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">&#8220;Yours,</span></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Thomas Tootler</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Waddy read this letter very carefully twice.
He folded and filed it with a bundle of old yellow
letters, written in a hand like his own, with so much
difference only as there may be between writing of
man and boy-man. He then, with the same extreme
deliberation, took from a portmanteau a mahogany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
box. In it were two eight-inch six-shooters, apparently
fired only once or twice for trial. Both
were loaded in every barrel of the cylinder with conical
ball. The caps were perfectly fresh, but Mr.
Waddy changed them all.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, Major Granby
came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your armory, eh?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You were
always a great amateur in shooting-irons. What&#8217;s
in the wind now? You look like an executioner.
What do you intend to slay&mdash;beast, man, or devil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I shoot, it will be to slay all three in one,&#8221;
said Waddy gravely.</p>

<p>He had a manner of intense and concentrated
wrath, quite terrible to see. The Ira of the man&#8217;s
nature was dominant.</p>

<p>Granby understood that this meant mischief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me?&#8221; he asked, quick but quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; replied his friend; &#8220;perhaps not at
all. I don&#8217;t like to talk of shooting until the time
comes to do it. Aiming too long makes the hand
tremble. You can understand, Granby, that the
world becomes a small and narrow place to walk in
when we meet an enemy deadly and damnable.
Now, without nourishing any ill-feeling, I begin to
half perceive that there may be a person whose life
and mine are inconsistent. You said I looked like an
executioner&mdash;it may be that I shall be appointed executioner
of such a person.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>&#8220;I know you too well,&#8221; said Granby, &#8220;to suppose
you capable of any petty revenge&mdash;this is grave, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is grave. Personal revenge is necessary for
the protection of society. There is crime that laws
take no notice of. Public opinion&mdash;public scorn&mdash;is
never quite reliable. Nor does public opinion protect
the innocent ignorant. There may be such
an absolutely dastard villain that, for the safety
and decency and habitableness of the globe, he
must die&mdash;and it is fortunate for society when
he outrages anyone to the point of deadly vengeance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you begin to see any light on the part of
your life that we have talked over by so many campfires?
Fifteen years is long to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No years are lost while a man is learning patience.
I remember that it took thirty years of my
life to teach me to regard my moral and mental
tremors and stumbles and falls with the same unconcern
that in my fifteenth year I did my childish
physical weaknesses. I suppose that one hour of
actual happiness now, which I am certainly not
likely to have, would explain my dark fifteen years.
Patience!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You expect to win happiness by killing your
man, eh?&#8221; questioned Granby.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; if I kill him, it will merely be from a
quickened sense of duty. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
lie in ambush like a Thug. I wait information and
entertain a purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, Sir Comeguys knocked at the door. They
had an appointment for a sailing party.</p>

<p>As they passed the parlour, Belden was sitting
with Mrs. Budlong. It was as much contact as was
possible in public, and some women allow liberal
possibilities.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much that Belden looks like your friend
Dunstan,&#8221; said Granby. &#8220;No compliment to Dunstan,
who is just the type American, chivalrous, half-alligator,
not without a touch of the non-snapping
but tenderly billing and cooing turtle. A graceful
union of Valentine and Orson. He is the finest fellow
I have seen and his giant friend, Paulding, is
made of the same porcelain in bigger mold. They
seem to have been everywhere and seen and done
everything, except what gentlemen should not do.
You&#8217;ll do well, Ambient, to model after them for
your Yankee life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doosed fine fellows,&#8221; said Ambient, &#8220;and Dunstan
has told me lots about buffalo hunting. This
fellow may look a little like Harwy Dunstan&mdash;but he
is older, seedier, and hawder. Harwy looks as fresh
as Adam before the fall. If he was not such an out-and-outer
and my fwiend, I should be savage at him
for cutting me out with Diana. She seemed to like
him, by George!&mdash;fwom the start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was Miss Clara,&#8221; said Ira, &#8220;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
that Granby would be gouging the young hero.
Paulding seems to me more devoted to Diana.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said Granby, &#8220;to pass from
bipeds to quadrupeds&mdash;that Mr. Belden is trying to
make up a race with that wide-travelling horse of
his? I heard him phrase it the other day that he
could &#8216;wipe out&#8217; Pallid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he should offer a bet on that, I wish you
would take it&mdash;for me, you understand&mdash;to any
amount,&#8221; said Ira. &#8220;His horse is a singed cat, but
Pallid don&#8217;t need any fire singeing him to make
him go. I didn&#8217;t think he could go as he does, but
he is working into it every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belden won&#8217;t stand a very large bet. He has
been subscribing, as they call it, to the Frenchman
lately. Are both those men lovers of your fat
friend&#8217;s wife? What villains some women are!
Bless them!&#8221; said Granby. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell me,
Ambient, that you had seen that Frenchman somewhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking at him every day,&#8221; replied Sir Com.
&#8220;I lost a thousand pounds to some fellows in Pawis
two years ago. I was gween then&mdash;a pwecious sight
gweener than I am now. Those fellows showed me
about Pawis, and all I know of the money is that I
lost the thousand one night at what they call a pwivate
hell. I was vewy dwunk at the time, I&#8217;m
ashamed to say, and have no doubt they plucked me.
I&#8217;m almost suah that this Fwenchman is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
same chaps. He&#8217;s diffewently got up, but if I can
spot him (as Skewwett says) I shall pound him
more or less&mdash;more, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do so, O six-feet Nemesis! and you will take
the house down. If you will mill the Gaul and
Waddy beat that contemptible fellow in the race&mdash;<i>Io
triumphe!</i> which means I not only owe but will
pay a triumphal supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>With talk like this, the gentlemen arrived at the
wharf. Why the boat they embarked in should be
called a &#8220;cat,&#8221; they could not discover. A cat is
fond of fish, as the poet hath it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;What female heart can gold despise?</div>
<div class="verse">What cat&#8217;s averse to fish?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Newport female hearts of the summer population
despise not, but, several of them at least, do
fitly esteem the yellow boys, and Newport cats and
those who sail in them are not averse to fishing for
fish and taking them. So Waddy smiled with his
friends and thought too much of Tootler&#8217;s letter.
He would watch Belden.</p>

<p>Meantime, Mr. Waddy saw the world continuously,&mdash;and
continuously was lionised. This has its
pleasures and its pains. It does not build up lofty
structures of respect towards the lioniser. Mr.
Waddy, however, always had the charm of sweet
refuge with his cousin, as he called her, Clara, fairest
of the fair, and her friend, the divine Diana.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
Mrs. Waddy made immense dinner parties for the
Returned Kinsman, where he met the people one
meets in that best world, of which his hostess is so
distinguished an ornament, etc.</p>

<p>The particularly distinguished guest of that summer
was the Hon. and Rev. Gorgias Pithwitch, the
epideiktic sophist of the nadir Orient. Mr. Pithwitch
was sometimes called &#8220;The Wizard of the
North.&#8221; He drew immense houses to his pleasant
jugglery. He had, that summer, as always, excellent
man! some amiable charity to assist&mdash;such as
to relieve Mahomet&#8217;s coffin from the painful uncertainties
of its position&mdash;or to purchase ashes of
roses to fill the cenotaph of Mausolus. Anything
elegiac or pensively sepulchral gave him a cue for
epideiktics or showing off.</p>

<p>Mr. Pithwitch spoke on the character of Mahomet
at Newport at the request of the Ladies&#8217; Coffin
Down Society. All the people who figure in this
history went. People always go to hear things. The
boys and girls thought the oration &#8220;thweet,&#8221; and so
it was&mdash;just about. Mr. Belden went with Mrs.
Budlong and whispered her safely through, playing
meanwhile familiarly with the fringe of her flounces.
How they began to eye each other now, those two!
Tim Budlong escorted Miss Saccharissa Mellasys.
A young poet, Edmund Waller by name, had fallen
desperately in love with the soft, startled eyes of
Saccharissa. She cast upon him sugar-melting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
glances, and he loved. Girls like poets and poets like
girls. But Edmund, in the intervals of his sonnetteering
Miss Mellasys, had been so unfortunate as to
beat Tim Budlong regularly at billiards. Tim was
in a porcupine state of mind and resolved to be revenged.
He devoted himself to Saccharissa and
she, well-knowing the cipher of the poet&#8217;s fortunes
and the <i>chiffre</i> of Tim&#8217;s, reciprocated the devotions.
They first began to appear together in public at
Pithwitch&#8217;s oration. People began to whisper. It
was at this period of his life that Waller wrote his
spasmodic poem, &#8220;The Beldame, or Blasted Hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Waddie, as has been said, made a dinner for
Mr. Pithwitch. It was part of her active business
in society to have all the lions properly treated, and
this was not the first whom Mr. Waddy had met at
her house. Mr. Pithwitch was, of course, an accomplished,
gentlemanly person and very much
liked.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that is your type orator,&#8221; Mr. Waddy murmured
through his cheroot to Dunstan, as they
walked home together; &#8220;the best among a myriad
talkers from a platform. I suppose he&#8217;s not able to
balance himself on a stump, and therefore is not out
doing his duty to what you call the Cause of Freedom
in this campaign. Is he ardent for that Cause?
Is he ardent for any cause? Is he a strong fiery
spirit? I trow not. Tell me of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon Dunstan gave Ira that sketch of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
character and genius of Mr. Pithwitch which has
just been read. Dunstan was quite familiar with
the men of this country who had done aught to
distinguish themselves, either positively or negatively.
The active life he had led had given him an
independence of thought not common among scholars.
He had already been through some tough political
experience in California in the Free State
struggle and was now, on his re-establishment at
home, nominated for Congress in his North River
district to replace a person who had voted for the
Nebraska bill. Dunstan was wanted at this very
time in the county of his nomination, and on the
stump everywhere; he was a young man of fervid
and passionate nature, quite untrammelled by any
law of life other than his own sense of right. If he
was needed elsewhere, why did he stay at Newport?
Men will often stay where they should not, longer
than they should, for several reasons, but principally
for female ones.</p>

<p>Ira and Dunstan were much together. They
talked over society and socialisms at much greater
length than can be here repeated. The younger man
represented the party of confident hope&mdash;the elder
did not see life, living, and livers in such brilliant
colours. Perhaps his sight was jaundiced.</p>

<p>In fact, for all his friends of the best, and for all
his lionising, Mr. Waddy did not cease to be often
lonely and often forlorn. Was he growing bilious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
again, or bored, that he found himself uneasy and
unhappy, and became again often filled with bitter
longing, and was forced to harden his heart with
study of a certain old yellow letter? He knew also
that it would be well if he looked less at his pistols.
It seemed an unworthy thing to be a spy upon Mr.
Belden&#8217;s movements. He saw that that gentleman
avoided him and he indulged himself in interferences
with this artful dodger&mdash;not spitefully, but because
he wished to observe him, and because he did
not love that a man he so thoroughly distrusted
should have power anywhere with anyone who
might confide.</p>

<p>All this was unhappy, unhealthy business. Why
return for such life as this? He began to talk with
Granby of their journeys and their hunts proposed;
but Granby, who, perforce, had become a Stoic,
hopeless of any return to his happy happiness, satisfied
himself very well where he was. There were
snipe and plover to be bagged; the bay still yielded
as good fish as had ever been taken. All the ladies
who rode were ready to be companioned by so distinguished
a cavalier. All who drove thought him
an agreeable and decorative object on the front seats
of the drivers&#8217; drags. He knew all the catsmen of
the docks. At every yachting party he, as well as
Waddy, was an indispensable. He bathed; he danced;
he astonished people at late, sleepy breakfasts by
coming in with vast appetite from seven-league<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
walks and presenting this pallid danseuse of the last
night&#8217;s hop with a wild rosebud from a hill a dozen
miles away, or that weary, nightless, ballful dowager
with a creamy, new-laid egg. He held his own at
the club, at billiards with the three ponies of the
summer: with Mr. Skibbereen, the cool, cautious
man and dashing player: with Blinders, the dashing
man and accurate, mathematical player: with Bob
O&#8217;Link, the sentimental man and nonchalant player.
Poor Bob O&#8217;Link used to hum lugubrious airs, such
as the serenade from &#8220;Trovatore,&#8221; and sigh to
Granby, particularly when he made a scratch, that a
man whose destiny it was to be a poet could only
attain to billiard-marker results.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too lucky,&#8221; said Bob O&#8217;, &#8220;to lose money.
Then I might grow poor and work. But I&#8217;m like
C&aelig;sar&mdash;wasn&#8217;t it <i>C&aelig;sar aut nullus</i>?&mdash;everything
I touch turns to gold.&#8221; And then he would
make a lunging stroke that the tyros talked of all
summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow!&#8221; said Granby. &#8220;You have reason
to be a disappointed man. I&#8217;ve known whole
families in the same condition. You&#8217;ll have to
marry a strong-minded woman and learn to run a
sewing machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any strong-minded women,&#8221; replied
Link, looking into an empty chalk-cup for chalk.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Miss Anthrope,&#8221; suggested Granby.
&#8220;Besides, Peter Skerrett says it&#8217;s one of the oldest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
and most respectable families. They came in, did
the Anthropes, with the creation. Marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you mention it, I believe I will,&#8221; cried Bob;
and he did. And Miss Anthrope, now Mrs. O&#8217;Link,
is one of the lights of the woman&#8217;s question, while
Bob O&#8217; is really happy at home in a cradle Elysium,
and would not give an obolus to be ferried back to
the mundane joys of his former life.</p>

<p>Major Granby was thus, in truth, useful as well
as agreeable, and with the feelings of a man who is
doing his duty towards himself and incidentally towards
others, including his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Ambient, he determined
to keep Mr. Waddy at Newport.</p>

<p>I should be doing great injustice to Granby did I
fail to say that, with all his pretence of personal enjoyment,
it was mainly on Ira&#8217;s account that he
stayed. Granby had not found his friend any less
malcontent out of the world than in it. He had
seen the same dreariness and utter dissatisfaction
overcome him in camps, in desert or forest; under
the special and immediate influence of Nature,
kindly restorer, he had seen him unrestored. Not
that his friend was morbid, inactive, sulky, dull,
selfish&mdash;never these. Such traits terminate companionship,
if not friendly regard. Ira was always,
when the time came for exertion, alert, bold, a trapper
of the most up-to-trap kind. But when the moment&#8217;s
fleeting purpose was o&#8217;ertook, he seemed to
care not for changing purpose into result. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
need for vivacity ceased, he returned into gloom.
His mental hermitage was always ready, where he
could become a Trappist of the Carthusian variety.
Voyaging over the wild regions of the earth had
done him no good. Granby saw that his friend had
not been happy out of society. The old wrong,
whatever it was, rankled&mdash;but it was old. Might it
not become out of date, obsolete? No man can ever
forget, no man wishes to forget; but he can console
himself. Why could not Mr. Waddy love, or like in
the range of loving, someone who might be made a
wife of? That would distract him&mdash;in one or other
sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the beautiful Clara, his cousin. How
happy might a man be in loving her,&#8221; thought
Granby, with a sigh for himself. &#8220;That fancy of
hers which I have detected for Dunstan, will pass
away when she sees he is Diana&#8217;s. Of course
Waddy is charmed with Clara. I believe the dog actually
presumes upon his kinsmanship and youthful
antiquity to the point of a kiss&mdash;confound him!&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<span class="small">IN WHICH MR. HORACE BELDEN PROSPERS CERTAIN<br />
PLANS</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DIANA had been left a few days with Miss Sullivan.
It was pleasant after the wide, rolling
sea, dreary sometimes and lonely in its grandeur, to
look quietly across the tranquil lawn upon a cultivated
landscape, full of life and homes of seeming
happy lives. Summer was ripening all along the
gentle slopes&mdash;a pleasant, quiet summer for Diana
and her hostess, and they spent the few days of
Diana&#8217;s stay in closest confidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Belden did not call upon Diana at Miss Sullivan&#8217;s,
but he discovered the day of her departure.
A carefully considered chance made him a passenger
on the same train. He did not appear until Miss
Sullivan had taken leave of her former pupil. Diana
had no fear of travelling alone. Railroad conductors
are among the errant knights of modern chivalry;
but I never heard that Diana needed protection.
She could wither impertinence with a look.
But though she did not need an escort, she did not
hate one, and when Belden came up with the manner
of his better self, she made place and accepted
him as companion of dustyish hours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>Diana was happy that day. Her talks with Miss
Sullivan had cleared away much darkness from her
mind. She was younger by many years than a week
before. All the beautiful sights and scenes of her
past fleeted before her in bright and changing pictures.
She was thinking much of her free and huntress
life in Texas. She could even forget the terrible
death of her mother. The whole story of that
dreadful event was no longer a dark secret with her
and one other, and that other she no longer dreaded
to meet&mdash;that other she need no longer exclude from
her presence and her thoughts.</p>

<p>A few hours with Miss Sullivan had changed the
current of her life. She was no longer drifting hopelessly
toward maddening terrors, forever in dread of
herself lest she should yield to a hope that she must
deem sacrilege. She had called Miss Sullivan
mother, and when that lady, studying her, perhaps
by the light of some bitter experience of her own,
had said, like a mother firm and wise, &#8220;My child!
you are hiding something from me,&#8221; Diana flung herself
into this mother&#8217;s arms, and with such agonised
tears as you had not looked for in her clear and fearless
eyes, told the secret that had been with her like
a death&mdash;between her and God and hope and life and
love.</p>

<p>And now that this, her mother, had shown her
how her guiltless and natural terrors were only
superstitions, and how she might blamelessly accept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
an offered happiness, should it ever offer, there
was no more vision of death between Diana and the
beloved hopes of her soul.</p>

<p>Yet she did not wish to think of the future; therefore
she was glad to be diverted in her journey by
an agreeable companion. And to him, also, it was
good to be with her. This radiant nature shone
upon him, and if there was anywhere in his being a
dwarfed and colourless germ of better emotion
among the thickets of his daily thoughts, this now
sprang up and seemed ready to flourish and blossom.
Belden, the petted and successful man, did not with
Diana promise himself his usual easy triumph. He
was willing to win her by pains. But sometimes in
this day, her manner was so transparently full of
happiness, and to him was so frank and gracious,
that he began to draw inferences rapidly favourable
to himself.</p>

<p>You have, perhaps, my young gentleman reader
of more or less purity of mind and ardent temperament,
sat apart in a poisoned mental ambush watching
the woman you loved, while some quite unworthy
personage, quite vulpine or quite viperine, was pouring
into her ears talk that made you feel like a fox-hound
or a snake exterminator. It was not that
the talk itself was poison&mdash;it was, perhaps, no more
than easy clap-trap, shining and shallow, cleverish
things, such as may suit a weekly newspaper, philosophy
of a man-about-town, gossip from all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
courts from the Grand Lama to Brigham Young&mdash;the
very subjects yourself would, like the cosmopolite
you are, have descanted on, were it not
that here you could only breathe phrases deep and devoted.
It is not the talk that troubles you; it is that
the talker, a man you know to be false and foul,
should bring his presence so near your shrine of
vestal purity. But pardon him, the viper, that he
eloquently orates, and pardon her, the Loved One,
that she answers gaily. Viper, under that good influence,
has perhaps ceased to be venomous; and the
Loved One is perhaps gay for remembering those
meaning words uttered by you so tenderly before the
serpent trailed in and you retired to discontented ambuscade
under the fiery shelter of crimson curtains.</p>

<p>Belden, whether he deceived himself or not, was
quite willing to think he had made a conquest of
Diana. He was one of those who have been encouraged
by vulgarish women, tending toward
demirepdom, to think that, when he entered, &#8220;all
fair, all rich&mdash;all won, all conquered stand.&#8221;
Diana was guiltless of any willing coquetry. She
was thinking of herself and did not concern herself
as to what impression she made upon others. But
unwittingly, by the gift of nature, she had all those
slight fascinations and winning charms that self-made
coquettes study for in laborious hours, and
persuade themselves they have attained.</p>

<p>Mr. Belden was, no doubt, properly solicitous for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Diana&#8217;s baggage. This goddess was mundane
enough to have made purchases beyond belief of
Parisian dresses. &#8220;I dare do all that may become a
man,&#8221; but to enter her boxes and describe their contents
I dare not. Thinking of Diana, one thought
not of the robes, but of the Mistress of the Robes.
Belden was experienced in the small cares of society.
It was part of his profession as a ladies&#8217; man
to recognise all properties of his escorted. She
therefore arrived unimpaired at Newport. Clara
Waddie, who met her at the boat, would hardly have
given the escort so cordial a reception. Mr. Belden,
probably, did not resemble any friend of hers.</p>

<p>Diana&#8217;s presence completed the charm of the
Waddies&#8217; house at Newport, and the house was a
worthy temple for its two deities, for Clara had always
been the mistress of its decorations, and her
cultivation and intuitive judgment were everywhere
apparent.</p>

<p>Clara and Diana! the A and B of this C, D, were
Dunstan and Paulding, a pair of the best men. A
noble thing is the friendship of two brothers in
love. California began just as they left college together.
They dashed off immediately. Being fellows
who were up to anything, they got on wonderfully.
They mined, drove coaches, were judges or
counsel at the plentiful hangings of the day. Each
of them shot a pillager or two and rescued a few
Mexicans and Chinamen from pillage by escaped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Australians. In the starvation winter, they headed
the party that relieved the involuntary cannibals of
the Sierra Nevada. They bought a ranch, and finding
on its edge among the hills a ready-money
boulder of gold, quite an Ajax cast in fact, they
opened dry diggings there and took out neat piles
before the outsiders came in. Then they took a
little run to San Francisco. Everyone who has had
California&mdash;and what one brave and bold of those
days is there that could have it and did not?&mdash;every
Californian of the early times knows what two men
drawing together, not indulging in hebdomadal big
drunks or diurnal little drunks, and not beguiled in
any sense by the sirens of the Bella Union or other
halls, what such a whole team could achieve. These
two friends, living together, acting together, having
common purse, common purposes for the future,
when they had seen the lights and shadows of this
phase of life, had gained each the other&#8217;s good qualities.
When they were together in presence, you
saw their marked difference of nature, marked as
their differences of physique. When they were
apart, each seemed the other&#8217;s counterpart. One
sometimes sees this singular likeness in man and
wife of some marriage of happy augury.</p>

<p>At San Francisco, they chanced to pick up one
of the Mexicans whom they had protected and befriended
in the mines. Through him they became
interested in a land claim, which the poor fellow had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
by inheritance. They carried it on in his behalf, and
when he died they found themselves by his will
owners of the claim. It was made good. They were
selling it at the fabulous prices of that day when
Paulding was recalled by his mother&#8217;s death. Dunstan
remained to close the business. He was able to
remit to his friend wealth for them both.</p>

<p>Dunstan returned home across the plains by New
Mexico and Texas. In the up-country of Texas, he
was detained some time by an accident. After some
delay, he joined his friend in New York. Several
years of toil and danger entitled them to brief repose.
When action again became necessary to
them, they essayed to revive at home the interest
they had felt in constructive politics in California,
but the ripeness of times had not yet come. The line
was not yet drawn upon the great national question
of America, which has since made the position of
man and man inevitable according to character and
education. Politics were not interesting.</p>

<p>Paulding observed his friend falling into melancholy.
Since the trip across the plains and the accident
in Texas, Dunstan had lost that ardent vigour
and careless hopefulness which had made him the
leader in their California adventures. Perhaps he
had achieved success too early and was blas&eacute;.
Paulding took his friend to Europe, where they remained
knocking about and occasionally amusing
themselves with making the aborigines stare with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
some stupendous California extravagance, until they
heard of Fr&eacute;mont&#8217;s nomination. They knew the
man. They had shared with him, and others good
and true, the labours of constituting the State of California.
He was one after their own hearts&mdash;a
gentleman pioneer&mdash;a scholar forester&mdash;a man of
untrammelled vigour and truth of character&mdash;a Californian,
which is a type of man alike incomprehensible
to the salon and the saloon. It was the man they
wanted; it was also the cause they wanted. They
made for home as friends, Californians, and lovers
of right, to take part in the campaign. Dunstan was
nominated for Congress at home, up the North River.
They went to Newport for days a few&mdash;they were
staying for many days.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Paulding and Dunstan had known the Waddies
and Clara in Europe. The two friends were presented
to Diana.</p>

<p>It was all over with Paulding at once&mdash;over head
and ears. So it happened with too many men who
met Diana.</p>

<p>Diana was very happy in these few weeks, brilliantly
happy. All their friends came constantly to
the Waddies&#8217;. At Newport, everyone is at leisure;
pleasure is the object. Where it dwells, all go. So
the young ladies held perpetual lev&eacute;es without
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes.</p>

<p>At these lev&eacute;es Mr. Belden appeared frequently.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
He was in most amicable and laudatory mood. He
pleased both the ladies by speaking in terms almost
affectionate of Miss Sullivan. He had known her,
he said, from his boyhood. They had been playmates
in the fresh days of childhood. Many a
morning he had gone proud to school with her rosebud
in his buttonhole. They had grown up together,
like brother and sister&mdash;no, more like cousins.
He spoke of it with some sentiment. She was
very lovely then.</p>

<p>&#8220;She seems to me still very lovely,&#8221; said Diana.
&#8220;The loveliest woman I have ever seen. There is a
serene sweetness and tranquillity in her beauty. No
one else has that look of tender resignation. She is
my idea of Faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belden uttered a strange sound like a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she is what you describe. She
has had need of resignation after so much domestic
trouble&mdash;her father&#8217;s disgrace&mdash;their poverty. And
then her life of teaching&mdash;ah! that can hardly have
been miserable, with pupils like you, young ladies!
We can hardly regret that she was compelled temporarily
to leave her own sphere for the purpose of
educating you to fill yours so charmingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are flattering Miss Sullivan through us,&#8221;
retorted Diana. &#8220;We thank you in her name. You
cannot praise her too highly. She is wise and good
and noble. Only I could wish that she were not so
sad.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>&#8220;Let us hope that her spirits will improve, now
that she is rich in the means to do good,&#8221; Belden
said.</p>

<p>In the same laudatory strain he spoke of Mr.
Waddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He, also, was one of my playmates. We have
been separated for several years, but I hope to
revive our old intimacy here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he always the same odd, hasty, irascible,
placable person?&#8221; asked Clara.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Belden; &#8220;we called him at school
Ira the Irate. It was always a tropical climate
wherever he was. I do not wonder he found our
boreal Boston too chilly for his nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not resemble at all the typical nabob,&#8221;
observed Diana. &#8220;He is not fat and curry-coloured.
He does not wear yellow slippers and Madras cravats
and queer white clothes of the last cycle. He
sits a morning with us and does not ask for ale. He
doesn&#8217;t call lunch tiffin. In fact, if he did not have a
Chinese servant and smoke an immense number of
cheroots, one could scarcely observe anything in
which he differs from other men of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much Chin Chin looks like Julia
Wilkes&#8217;s friends, Mr. Cutus and Mr. Fortisque,&#8221;
said Clara.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those two unfortunate youths, with chop-stick
legs, no perceptible moustache, complexions <i>de foie
gras</i>?&#8221; and Belden laughed. &#8220;The bohoys call them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Shanghais. They are indeed changeling Chinese&mdash;not
quite men. There is in South America one variety
of monkey that has a moustache&mdash;most have
not&mdash;they have not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does Julia allow such amorphous objects
to be perpetually before her?&#8221; asked Diana.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have surrounded her,&#8221; Clara replied.
&#8220;She is very good-natured and not very wise. One
of them is always standing sentinel. I suppose no
clever man likes to have a sprightly fool forever
standing by and filling vacancy with smiling dumminess
while he is talking. So the clever men have
actually been thrust away from poor Julia by these
two pertinacious friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very different from your two civilised California
friends,&#8221; said Belden, still in a complimentary
vein.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know them in California?&#8221; asked
Diana.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I was in San Francisco. They were up
the country. They were well known from their
efficiency in relieving the starved emigration
of &#8217;49, and from the very active part they took
[G&mdash; d&mdash;n them!] in making California a free
State.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belden went on commending judiciously the
friends, whom he hated on general principles and
found in his way at present. He relieved himself by
internal salvos of cursing and achieved his object of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
buttering all his antagonists, so that he could slip by,
as he hoped, and win the prize. He <i>must</i> win. Yes.
Or what?</p>

<p>&#8220;How handsomely he spoke of Paulding and
Dunstan,&#8221; said Clara, after he had gone. &#8220;I must
learn to think better of a man who has the rare
virtue of not being jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be,&#8221; said Diana, &#8220;that he was ever attached
to Miss Sullivan? He speaks almost tenderly
of her. I have noticed a certain coolness or awkwardness
between them hardly to be accounted for
in any other way. If it is so, he shows another rare
trait, that of remembering without unkindness a
woman who has rejected him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So this serpent charmed away Clara&#8217;s prejudices,
or for a moment persuaded her that she was unjust,
and beguiled Diana into something more like intimacy.
They, as innocent women, knew very little
of the man. And, indeed, there were no positive
charges against him, except that he was what is
pleasantly called a &#8220;lady-killer.&#8221; Their gentlemen
friends, though sharing in the general distrust of
him, had no brother&#8217;s privilege of warning against
an acquaintance, if merely undesirable. Therefore,
the ladies did not hear of Mr. Belden&#8217;s flirtation
with Mrs. Budlong. The Waddies did not know
her. Her storming of good society had taken place
during their absence. Mr. Belden, in reply to their
inquiries, spoke of her with respect.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>Diana, at this time, occasionally felt a slight recurrence
of that pain in her side which has already
been noticed. Once when Belden was accompanying
her in a ride, a privilege he now frequently had,
this pain for a moment overcame her terribly. She
would have fallen but for his ready aid and judgment.
She was restored in a moment and insisted
upon continuing her ride. Belden was even better
received than usual when he called in the evening to
make proper inquiries. He had shown a very respectful
delicacy and was rewarded by gratitude and
an invitation to dinner. He congratulated himself
upon his luck and hoped the lady would faint every
day.</p>

<p>Diana was seized with this same pain one evening
when she was sitting a little apart with Dunstan.
He sprang to support her. She had strength to
repel him, almost rudely. Clara retired with her a
moment till the spasm passed. When the gentlemen
took their leave, which they did immediately upon
the ladies&#8217; re-entrance, Diana gave her hand to
Dunstan, as if to apologise. Her manner was grave,
even solemn, as she said to him some commonplaces
of thanks for his intended courtesy.</p>

<p>Clara felt some anxiety for her sister-friend.
What meant these sudden pains? Diana made light
of them. They were nothing, transitory only&mdash;a reminder
of an unimportant hurt she had received in
Texas. She was perfectly well&mdash;and so she seemed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
brilliantly full of life, that must sing and laugh and
blush at each emotion.</p>

<p>There arose a singular coolness between the sisters
at this time&mdash;a lover&#8217;s quarrel, as it were; and
yet no quarrel, but a seeming hesitancy before some
more perfect confidence. They were more affectionate
than ever when together, but more apart, shunning
each other, talking of trifles. Clara was conscious
of this partial estrangement. In fact, it was
almost wholly on her side. The high and careless
spirits of her friend seemed to jar upon her. She
seemed to long for solitude. Anywhere but at
Newport in the summer, she might have indulged in
lonely walks. There she was compelled to encounter
the world and be gay with it.</p>

<p>But she grew pale&mdash;they told her so. She said it
was moonshine. And so it was&mdash;beautiful moonshine&mdash;sweet,
melancholy pallor; but bloom was
better. Sorrow, unmerited, came to her&mdash;sorrow
such as even to herself she could not confess. The
wish, the hope that she would not admit, for all its
besetting sieges, would make her untrue to herself
and disloyal to her friend. Disloyal to Diana&mdash;her
rival! The first was as far from her thoughts as
the last seemed unimaginable. No one could be the
rival of Diana!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<span class="small">MR. BELDEN CONTEMPLATES VILLAINIES,<br />
NEW AND OLD</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BELDEN was the only guest at the dinner at
Mr. Waddie&#8217;s in recognition of his care of
Diana. It was a satisfactory affair to him, the principal
actor. The to eat was good; the to drink
sparkling; the to wit brilliant; the to woo he thought
promising.</p>

<p>It was not late when Mr. Belden reached the Millard
on return from this fortunate occasion. They
were hopping, reciprocating to the Nilvederes.
There was tempting wealth of <i>&eacute;talage</i>, but Belden
slipped through the side door and up to his room.
He took from one of his double-locked trunks a
small tin case, such as men who have securities
keep them in. He unlocked the case and took from
it a bundle of papers, old papers carefully enveloped.
They were endorsed &#8220;Ira Waddy&#8217;s Letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belden opened the parcel and looked at several of
the letters. Some were signed &#8220;Ira Waddy,&#8221; or
&#8220;Ira&#8221;; some &#8220;Sally Bishop.&#8221; They were such
letters as some women exchange with some
men, but such as only vile men and women write.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Belden seemed to enjoy the tone of these epistles
hugely.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a bitch that girl was,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;Waddy missed it when he was such a Puritan with
her. She was a bad one to have for enemy. She
thought getting up the letters a glorious joke. How
we roared over some passages. I think I should have
let the thing drop after proposing it, if she hadn&#8217;t
been so mad for it. It was a devilish risky thing
to do. The fellow would kill me in a minute if he
knew it, but Sally won&#8217;t peach before she dies, I
think. The other woman is safe, damn her! She
and Waddy are the only two people that ever baffled
me. But I&#8217;ve had what I call a neat revenge&mdash;I
should think so. She might much better have
smiled upon me for her own good. As to Waddy,
he don&#8217;t seem over-civil now. I shouldn&#8217;t mind
closing the whole thing up by shooting him. Miss
Diana seems to have a liking for fighting men. I&#8217;m
getting on fast with her. She&#8217;s a little of a bolter,
but I can soon tame her, once in hand. Well, I
thought I would burn these letters, but they&#8217;re a
little too rich. When I&#8217;m engaged to her, I&#8217;ll
burn &#8217;em and reform. Some people would call it
forgery&mdash;writing those documents&mdash;bah! what&#8217;s
forgery!&#8221;</p>

<p>He began scribbling names in various hands: his
own, Ira Waddy, Diana, Betty Bud, Bet Budlong,
Sally Bishop, Tootler, Janeway, Sullivan, Perkins,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
and others, just as recollection seemed to associate
those whom he had known in former life or
now.</p>

<p>While he was scribbling, there came a knock at
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; called Belden, tossing the papers
into their case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s me, sir,&#8221; answered a cockney voice.</p>

<p>Belden unlocked the door and admitted a very
bandy-legged groom, neatly enough dressed, but
topped by a most knavish head and face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Figgins,&#8221; said his master, &#8220;what do you
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will ye &#8217;ave Knockknees, sir, hin the mornink
harely? Ye can go hon the beach hat sevenk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring him up at seven, then; the race must come
off now in a few days. I&#8217;m ringing in these precious
greenhorns. They&#8217;ll all run their damned cows,
but they haven&#8217;t got enough to bleed much. I want
to get that fellow in with his black horse. He&#8217;ll
bleed gold. Can I beat him on the square, do you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi dunno, sir,&#8221; said Figgins, &#8220;&#8217;e&#8217;s a stepper,
his that black. Hi never see such a &#8217;oss for clean
goin&#8217;. You mout beat, hand you moutn&#8217;t. But
p&#8217;r&#8217;aps &#8217;e&#8217;ll be summat sick,&mdash;a little sick, &#8217;nough to
take the edge hoff &#8217;im hat the race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he will,&#8221; agreed Belden, instantly accepting
the hint. &#8220;You might look at him once or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
twice and let me know whether it&#8217;s likely. You
know where his stable is&mdash;can you get in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s keys to be &#8217;ad, I s&#8217;pose. Do you want
&#8217;im to show hat all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I hope he&#8217;ll be well enough to make
good play. He might win a heat&mdash;then I can get
more out of &#8217;em. You understand? It will pay you
devilish well if I win a jolly pile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi see, sir,&#8221; said Figgins, and with a furtive
look at the tin case, he went out.</p>

<p>Belden locked the case and put it away. The full
luxurious sound of music from the hall swelled up
again after a pause and filled the room. Some men
are purified from baser wishes by the delicate sensualities
of passionate music; but not such men as
Belden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, a galop!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I must go down
and have a stampede and hug with Mrs. Bud. Dear
Betty Bud! I think I get on rather faster with her
than with Miss Diana.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the glass to arrange his toilet for
the deranging struggles of the hop. He did not
perceive that the look of his three villainies of the
evening was stamped upon his face&mdash;three, one remembered,
two meditated. He thought it was the
effect of age, the change he began to be conscious
of in his appearance. But age, of those whose lives
are worthy to endure, softens and tranquillises expression
and harmonises colouring; it does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
darken the shadows where they had grown dark
on his face, nor give the unpeaceful and uneasy
look he had.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must hold up for a while,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I
wish I could keep away from that damned faro place.
My luck is dished lately. However, I&#8217;ll make that
race square the accounts. If it don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m up a
tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went down Jacob&#8217;s Ladder. Millard&#8217;s parlour
was nearly as deserted as its namesake of political
supporters. All the Millarders and the Nilvederes,
with a decimation of outsiders and farthermores,
were taking their constitutional perspiration bath in
the dining rooms&mdash;tables having been turned out for
the occasion. Trotting polkas, racking redowas,
cantering waltzes, galloping galops&mdash;bipeds were
being put through all their paces.</p>

<p>The old flirtations were going on swimmingly in
the damp intervals of dance; and lo! a new one.
Bob O&#8217;Link was for the first time devoted to Miss
Anthrope. That strong-minded young person had,
in the most feeble-minded manner, succumbed at
once when Bob O&#8217; suddenly and newly appeared in
the ballroom and unanimously singled her out for
a permanent partner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Anthrope has decided to take a false position,&#8221;
said Peter Skerrett to Gyas and Cloanthus,
who were swabbing and drying off at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Has she, though!&#8221; said Gyas. &#8220;What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
is it? She looks to me as well on her pins as
usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is going to marry for money&mdash;that is the
false position, a pillory that neither man nor woman
ever escaped from. Well, Bob O&#8217; will stand by her
better than most fellows. Look at the chap. He is
as sure to win in love, particularly the bought variety,
as at billiards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand by, Peter,&#8221; said Gyas; &#8220;I&#8217;m going to say
a good thing. Miss Anthrope will be linked to Link,
in the links of high man&#8217;s chain. Capital, isn&#8217;t it?
Now, Clo, don&#8217;t you get ahead of me and say that to
Julia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honour among friends,&#8221; returned Cloanthus.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you odds, Guy, on Bob O&#8217;Link. Ten to
one he gets her in ten days; five to one in five days;
two to one on to-morrow&mdash;and even it&#8217;s done to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better save your money, boys,&#8221; said
Peter. &#8220;Not that you&#8217;ll spend it in charity, but
you&#8217;ll want it all to pay what you&#8217;ll lose on the race
Belden is getting up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he comes now with Mrs. Budlong,&#8221; said
Gyas Cutus. &#8220;By Golly, isn&#8217;t she a stunner! Belden
looks deuced hard to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find him hard enough&mdash;hard as one of
Millard&#8217;s eggs. I recommend you both to keep away
from him and his horse,&#8221; said Peter.</p>

<p>Here the music struck up a galop and the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
flexible youths, pocketing their moist <i>batistes</i>, tore
wildly into the affray. Mr. Belden dashed by with
Mrs. Budlong in his arms.</p>

<p>He had found her t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant.
Their whispered conversation closed as Belden
approached, and bowed his request for a dance.
&#8220;Hot nubbless&#8221; looked after her wickedly as she
moved away.</p>

<p>Sir Comeguys, passing with Granby, looked into
the parlour. Sir Com saw the Frenchman standing
there with his vicious look and his clenched fist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gwanby,&#8221; said the bold and battailous Briton,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t be wong&mdash;that is the scoundwel that helped
to wob me in Pawis. He called himself Lavallette
then, or some such name.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<span class="small">THE BRAVE PREPARE FOR A RACE, THE FAIR FOR A<br />
PICNIC</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NEXT morning after Millard&#8217;s hop, several of
our acquaintance met on the piazza.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened at the subscription party last
night?&#8221; asked Peter Skerrett of Gyas, who looked
blue and slumbrous as a night policeman.</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t do a very heavy business,&#8221; responded
Guy. &#8220;Lob Lolly subscribed three hundred.
Hobble de Hoy collected two-fifty. Belden
lost like leaking. De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant was collecting
pretty well, till Sir Com Ambient came in and sat
down opposite; then he seemed to get flustrated, subscribed
once or twice, and went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an astonishing feller that Belden is!&#8221; said
Cloanthus. &#8220;There he comes in on Knockknees,
and we&#8217;ve only just grubbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belden gave his horse to Figgins and lounged up
the steps. He affected a dignified indifference with
the younger men generally, but this morning he was
quite gracious. They were discussing the preliminaries
of the race. They had talked of a steeple-chase,
but the riders did not come forward very
freely, and they had determined to have a formal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
race; mile heats on the second beach, best two in
three, free to all ages, no handicap&mdash;in short, a kind
of scrub race.</p>

<p>While they were talking it over, Chin Chin
brought up Pallid. Mr. Waddy was going for a
morning ride with Clara and Diana. There were
divers opinions on Pallid&#8217;s merits. Some of them
said he was too handsome to make time&mdash;&#8220;a good un
to go should always be a bad un to look at,&#8221; and there
were instances enough on this side. There were also
abundant instances on the other. In short, no one
had seen him put to his speed, and none could do
more than conjecture how low he would go down
in the seconds. A very few seconds make the great
differences in horses, as the minor, imperceptible
charms distinguish between the few beautiful and
the many pretty among women. It was conceded
that it was a sin to race on the beach. &#8220;The horses&#8217;
feet will be ruined; the beach is as hard as Macadam.&#8221;
But they had determined to do it. There
was an <i>&eacute;clat</i> about the beach that no other place
could have.</p>

<p>Belden said that Pallid was a very fine animal&mdash;the
handsomest horse he knew&mdash;very fast, too; very
fast. He was surprised that Mr. Waddy had not
entered him. Perhaps Mr. Waddy did not want to
win their money&mdash;very likely! He couldn&#8217;t know,
of course, anything about the comparative powers
of the two horses, but if Pallid were in the race, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
wouldn&#8217;t fear to back his horse against him for a
thousand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that for an offer?&#8221; asked Major
Granby, joining the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would make it one if the horse were in the
race,&#8221; answered Belden.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is getting interesting,&#8221; said Peter Skerrett;
&#8220;and just in time here comes Dunstan, and Mr.
Waddy to speak for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys crowded round Mr. Waddy to persuade
him to enter his horse. Guy and Clo wished to see
Belden beat; he had scoffed at them for being imberb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy, &#8220;anything to
please the children; but I can&#8217;t ride him myself. I
carry too much weight for a race. Pallid&#8217;s only five.
I say, Dunstan, don&#8217;t you want to ride him? You
are just my height&mdash;five feet ten&mdash;but then I outweigh
you fifteen pounds&mdash;two pounds a year for
the difference in our ages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted,&#8221; said Dunstan, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll
trust me. Is there anything on it besides the
stakes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is as Mr. Belden pleases,&#8221; said Granby.
&#8220;Do you hold to the offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; responded Belden, and the bet was
booked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were betting with Belden,&#8221; said Gyas, aside
to Peter Skerrett, &#8220;I should want stakes up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>&#8220;You would behave with your usual asinine indecorum,
Guy, my boy, if you hinted such a thing.
Belden is not a man to back down. He&#8217;d rather
murder somebody and get the money. If he loses,
he&#8217;ll pay. But he don&#8217;t intend to lose. He knows
his horse, and I&#8217;d advise you not to bet against him.
In fact, the best thing you and Clo can do is to stop
betting entirely and put your money in your old
boots. I&#8217;ve been talking like a father to you two for
years, and you don&#8217;t improve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what do you want us to do, Peter?&#8221;
asked they penitently, by Gyas, principal spokesman.
&#8220;Everybody is down on us. We try to do the fair
thing. We pay our tailor&#8217;s bills and don&#8217;t smoke
over five cigars a day. We don&#8217;t know what to do.
Miss Sullivan, up at The Island this summer, used
to pitch into us and say we ought to have ambition.
Well, I did try politics once and went to the polls to
vote. There was an Irish beggar who swore he&#8217;d
seen me vote twice before. That rather knocked my
politics. I&#8217;ve read all Thackeray, and Buck on the
&#8216;Sublime,&#8217; and Tennyson&#8217;s &#8216;Sacred Memories,&#8217;
and the &#8216;Pickwick Club.&#8217; Then about religion&mdash;I&#8217;ll
be blowed if I can keep awake in church. It&#8217;s no
go. I try every Sunday. The Doctor can&#8217;t do it,
and he&#8217;s allowed to be the best preacher in the world.
I get asleep and have bustin&#8217; nightmares on account
of the painted windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, try to be good boys. Don&#8217;t bet, and I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
see if I can think of something for you,&#8221; said
Peter.</p>

<p>The season was drawing to a close. There had
been no earthquakes of excitement, no avalanches of
clean or dirty scandal. Indeed, since the Pithwitch
oration, there had been no event at Newport. People
actually began to talk of going away too soon.
The race, then, was the right thing at the right
time. People began to talk of it astonishingly.
Major Granby had, people said, ten thousand
dollars bet with Mr. Belden. Major Granby was,
so report alleged, a younger son of the Marquis
of Grimilkin, and had made an enormous fortune
on the turf. Rev. Theo. Logge said that he
disapproved very much of betting, but that he
should ask the winner to contribute to the Cause&mdash;he
did not say whether the Lee Scuppernong
cause or not. He hoped that his sister in the
faith, Mrs. Grognon, would not interrupt her drive
to the beach for these carnal excitements. Perhaps
it was as well that she should see the race, to
know for the future what to avoid. He would escort
her and gain experience, which would be valuable
to him in warning young men not to go to
such scenes of temptation.</p>

<p>All the ladies became partisans. Miss Milly
Center asked Mr. Dulger if he should ride.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no horse,&#8221; said Billy, safe in that negation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Miss Millicent, &#8220;Sir Com Ambient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
has none, and he says he intends to hire one just for
the fun of the start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unhappy Billy Dulger, whom nature did not
shape to fit a saddle, must not be outdone by Sir Com,
whom Milly quoted constantly. Billy consulted a
livery-stable man. This personage provided Billy
with a four-legged quadruped.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t win the first heat,&#8221; said the man,
&#8220;nor perhaps the second; but git him through those,
and I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised at anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob O&#8217;Link entered his horse. Miss Anthrope,
her nature seemingly changed with her proximate
change of name, hung about him tenderly, praying
him not to ride. She preferred that he should not be
killed, for with his death would die Mrs. O&#8217;Link <i>in
posse</i>.</p>

<p>Blinders entered a headlong steed. He generally
rode him with two snaffles, one around his waist, the
other in his two hands. Blinders did not talk about
his horse. He was a fellow who always went slap
at anything without a word; but he looked at all the
horses and thought his own chance was good. His
horse was called Nosegay, on account of the gayness
of his nose.</p>

<p>Little Skibbereen besieged his mamma to let him
enter with Gossoon, but mamma had prejudices
against the breaking of Skibby&#8217;s neck. Scalper,
the artist, arrived in time. He would ride Gossoon,
who was one of the favourites. Unfortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Scalper was too amusing a fellow not to be fat, and
he outweighted Gossoon.</p>

<p>Guy and Clo, though <i>fortes ambo</i> in a buggy, were
not accustomed to bestride the prancing steed.
Paulding reserved himself to drive Diana and Clara.</p>

<p>There was question between Tim Budlong and De
Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant which should bounce upon Drummer.
When the Gaul discovered that Sir Comeguys was
to contend, he remembered that Drummer seemed to
have unreasonable prejudices against him, and if he
should endeavour to subdue that very priceless steed
with spiteful whip and spur, some displeasure might
arise on the part of Mr. Budlong. Tim therefore
proposed himself and Drummer for victory, and the
fair Saccharissa Mellasys bestowed upon him a
lovely jockey cap of blue and white satin gores.
Tim&#8217;s face was by this time pale and flabby, and he
did not look the handsomer for his fresh head-piece.</p>

<p>Thus, a field of eight was entered, as many as
could conveniently start on the beach. Peter Skerrett,
by common consent, became the <i>impresario</i> of
the occasion. Interest rather centred upon Pallid
and Knockknees on account of the bet pending.
Some of the knowing ones backed Blinders and
Nosegay for the purse. A few trusted to Bob
O&#8217;Link&#8217;s personal reputation for luck, and one or
two backed Drummer, thinking Tim could not possibly
persuade him to be beaten.</p>

<p>While the gentlemen were thus ardently preparing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
for their Olympic games, the ladies also had their
scheme of festivity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do for Milly Center on her birthday?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Wilkes, that unwearied chaperon.</p>

<p>Miss Millicent was not too old to have a birthday
on the day before the race. Mr. Dulger was
aware of this epoch and had written to Bridgeman
for a barrel of flowers. Dulger&#8217;s clerkly salary&mdash;for
his stern papa kept him on a salary much too exiguous
for his exigencies&mdash;his salary hardly sufficed
for his systematic floral tributes. He had been
obliged to write to the bookkeeper in Front Street
for another temporary loan. Billy had presentiments
that the crisis of his fate was at hand. He
would not fail at the last for want of sufficient investment.
A flower barrel was a <i>grandiose</i> gift.
He was confident that no one else had thought of it.
True love makes a Dulger a genius. If the wooed
could not be won by a barrel of flowers, he would
forever fly her false toleration and among the flour
barrels toilsomely regain his wasted bouquet money.
Poor Billy Dulger! So long a Tolerated, he was
weary of this &#8220;longing much, hoping little, asking
naught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall Milly&#8217;s birthday be honoured?&#8221; was,
however, still a question for the generality. Each
suggested other things and a picnic.</p>

<p>&#8220;A picnic, of course,&#8221; said the masterly Mrs.
Wilkes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>&#8220;To the Dumplings, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes; how could we think of anything
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a band,&#8221; said Julia, &#8220;and dancing on the
grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a boatload of champagne,&#8221; said Cloanthus.</p>

<p>&#8220;No flirtations allowed,&#8221; suggested Peter Skerrett.</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Well, then, flirtations compulsory; first,
with Miss Milly, Queen of the Day, afterwards with
our private Queens of Hearts,&#8221; and he chanted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The Queen of Hearts she brought some Tarts</div>
<div class="indent">Unto a Picnic gay;</div>
<div class="verse">The King of Hearts he ate the Tarts</div>
<div class="indent">And gave his Heart away.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is not very important, but be it hereby known
unto thee, O outsider of Kenosha, Stamboul, Fond
du Lac, Paris, Natchez under the Hill, London,
Lecompton, or Jerusalem! that the Dumplings of
Newport <i>is</i> an old stone fort, not <i>are</i> certain
apples enclosed in certain unwholesome strata of
dough.</p>

<p>Picnics go to the Dumplings as a shad to fresh
water in spring, as a moth to a candle, as a swain to
a nymph. They go there in boats over the smooth
bay, across the strait, where a soft, lulling prolongation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
of the distant ocean swell reaches the navigator
with sweet reminder motion. When picnics arrive
at the Dumplings, they stroll about; their better
halves are handed over the rocks by their worse
halves; they view that crumbling, cheese-shaped object,
the fort, and say sweet things of salt water and
sunshine. They chat. They romp. Then comes the
climax&mdash;to eat the picnic. Picnics are properly
eaten with the fingers. The idea is to return to
Arcadian manners.</p>

<p>Picnics being well known by all the fair and brave,
who deserve each other, as so charming and offering
such charming opportunities for attaining their
deserts, there is no wonder that everyone was delighted
with Mrs. Wilkes&#8217;s scheme. Miss Millicent,
as the heroine of the occasion, gave deep thought to
her toilet. She was resolved to be captivating as
Miss Millicent, that is for herself; not as Miss Center,
that is for her fortune. She had always adorers
enough, besides the inevitable Dulger, but he was
her thrall and the others she had flirted through.
She had been observed to be dissatisfied of late. Was
it that she had failed with Sir Comeguys? Or did
some other novelty refuse to enter her toils? Or
was there some escaped one whom she wished to beguile
back again with penitential wiles? Or was she
a little ashamed of her exacting, not immoral,
<i>cicisbeism</i> with poor Billy? For whatever reason,
Miss Milly seemed a little disappointed, and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Wilkes, not thinking it proper that any of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;es
should be out of spirits, hoped well of the picnic,
that it would restore the heiress to amiability.
So Mrs. Wilkes shopped extravagantly with Miss
Milly and the girls.</p>

<p>Clara and Diana were of course to be of the party.
They were really the belles. The men who fell in
love with Diana that summer, and some of them
were stanch old belle-ringers, say that she was the
culmination; that there never was and never will
be another like her. And then, some stanchest old
member of the pack gives tongue and says &#8220;Except
Clara,&#8221; and the whole pack cry &#8220;Except Clara&#8221;&mdash;Clara
not second in order, but only subsequent in
thought.</p>

<p>Everybody, in a word, was to be at the picnic.
Everybody means thirty or forty people. Good Mrs.
Wilkes had a moment&#8217;s hesitation about Mrs. Budlong,
and privately consulted Peter Skerrett, her
Grand Vizier. Peter, with his usual thoughtfulness,
pointed out that Miss Arabella couldn&#8217;t go
without her mother; so Mrs. B. was invited. Mrs.
Aquiline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Retrouss&eacute;e, had recently begun a dead
set at Mr. Waddy. She engaged ardently in the
project. There would be a band and a boatload of
champagne and a sail home by moonlight.</p>

<p>In short, Miss Milly Center&#8217;s birthday picnic was
to be the event of the season. Her spirits rose as
she beheld her most becoming dress, and she prognosticated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
for herself no solemn epoch of repentance
and reform, but an auroral dawn of new flirtations
with full recovery of all the old, an <i>annus mirabilis</i>
of social success and scores of manly hearts trampled
under foot.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<span class="small">MISS CENTER&#8217;S BIRTHDAY PARTY AND WHAT OCCURRED<br />
THEREAT</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE fateful day dawned. Fair were the omens
of the morning; full their accomplishment as
day culminated. Oh, what a parade there was!
Chiefly and Chieftainly the Millard sent forth its
fleet full of younkers and prodigals and &#8220;skarfed
barks,&#8221; flaggy with dizzy floating of ribbons. Commodore
Mrs. Wilkes headed this centre of the squadron.
Commodore? I will rather say Admiral of all
the grades, red, white, and blue; <i>libert&eacute;</i>, <i>&eacute;galit&eacute;</i>, <i>fraternit&eacute;</i>&mdash;these,
under her admiral conduct, were to
be the watchwords of the day. And now from many
a cottage of gentility, from many a sham ch&acirc;teau, if
possible more genteel, they were pouring and thronging
in full-sailed bravery toward the rendezvous.</p>

<p>They were landed in a lovely cove near the Dumplings.
Mr. Dulger was ardent in his endeavours to
aid the Queen of the Day, Miss Millicent, in disembarking;
so ardent that Nemesis thought he needed
quenching, and so quenched him a little. He slipped
knee-deep into the water with a ducking splash.
Dunstan handed the lady out, while Peter Skerrett
picked Billy up with a mild reproof.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>The party was one of many elements; these soon
grouped or paired in elemental concord, and all the
slopes were gay with the sight of lolly circles, and
jocund with the sound of their lively laughter. The
band piped unto them and somewhat they essayed to
dance upon the undulating sward. It was remarked
by the Millarders that Mr. Belden and Mrs. Budlong
were absent a long time, and that afterwards he was
very devoted to Diana. It was also remarked that
Miss Arabella was getting tired of the Frenchman.
Dear me! how people do remark things.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy did not feel out of place at the picnic,
because, as a man of the universal world, he was always
in place; but he was out of spirits. Tootler
wrote no more. Ira was wretched with suspenses
and suspicions. Poor old Budlong&mdash;here was this
wife of his hardly concealing her intrigue with Belden&mdash;her
second intrigue, and this time not with a
blackleg, but with one whom, he feared, was a villain.
Belden, too, was intimate with Diana, favoured
by Clara; and Ira could not warn them. He
had nothing except suspicion. His judgment, sharpened
by this, saw Belden as he was&mdash;plausible, flattering,
laborious to please, cautious of offence,
clever, experienced, a man of that very dangerous
class who see the better and follow the worse. Mr.
Waddy, therefore, seeing Belden&#8217;s success, was
filled with wrath. The old man Ira began to take
control of his lately stoical nature.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting dangerous,&#8221; he felt; and not all the
petting of Mrs. Aquiline, nor all the attentions of the
daughtery mothers and nubile daughters, could distract
him or make him distracted from this ugly
presence of hateful thoughts. He observed that
Belden was uneasy when he was by, and concealed
his unease by a seeming cordiality. Mr. Waddy began
to tingle with a nervous sensation of presentiment
that there was to be a crisis, an explanation, a
punishment, a vengeance&mdash;what and for what he
could not yet foresee.</p>

<p>By-and-by, the happy moment arrived for which
all other deeds at a picnic are only preparatory. The
edible and potable picnic was announced as ready to
be eaten and drunk, and a truly Apician banquet it
was&mdash;thanks to Mrs. Wilkes, experienced giver of
dinners and liberal feeder of mankind. Some of the
banqueting was very pretty to behold. Fair ladies
are not ignoble in the act of taking ladylike provender.
But it must also be allowed that some of the
banqueting was not so pretty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at Rev. Theo. Logge,&#8221; said Peter Skerrett
to Ambient; &#8220;he pretends to wish that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent7">&#8220;&#8216;All the world</div>
<div class="verse">Should in a pet of temperance feed on pulse,</div>
<div class="verse">Drink the clear stream&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;But observe, that is not pulse he eats, but p&acirc;t&eacute; of
Strasburg, and what he is pouring down is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
stream, to be sure, a large one and clear, but it comes
from a very poptious bottle. I cannot think it
water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Peter,&#8221; says Guy, &#8220;let&#8217;s fuddle the Rev.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guyas Cutus,&#8221; reproved Peter gravely, &#8220;you
are a pagan. I have frequently remarked that difference
between Cloanthus and you. You are a
pagan and swear &#8216;I Gaads.&#8217; He is a monotheist and
swears &#8216;I Gaad&#8217;. In this case you can spare yourself
a sacrilege. Mr. Logge is fuddling himself.
Hillo,&#8221; he added, looking up suddenly as a cork
struck him hard on the ear.</p>

<p>De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant had opened a champagne bottle
carelessly and had not only bombarded Peter, but
had deluged Sir Comeguys. Sir Com looked quietly
at the Frenchman, waiting for an apology; none
came, but the bottle-holder gave a blackguard laugh.
He must have been a little elated by drinking, and
reckless. Miss Arabella had been particularly cool
to him all day, and it had taken much wine to
counterbalance his chagrin. No one saw the little
scene except Blinders and Mrs. Budlong, and the
banquet went on and off brilliantly.</p>

<p>While the gentlemen were lighting cigars and separating
for a few moments from the ladies, Blinders
tapped De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Com Ambient would like to say a word to
you behind the hill yonder,&#8221; he said with a meaning
look. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see fair play for you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>Auguste Henri, who had continued his draughts
intemperately, first turned pale and then blustered
and vinously vapoured that he would not go at any
man&#8217;s dictation&mdash;he didn&#8217;t owe any apology to &#8220;<i>ce
niais</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to go,&#8221; said Blinders calmly, but
with conviction. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t make any apology
for insulting him as you did. But you must stand
up to the rack, or you can&#8217;t stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Blinders quietly led off his man, cursing in
French like the rattling of a locomotive. They found
Peter Skerrett and Sir Com waiting behind the hill.
The latter had his coat off, and was tramping this
way and that, like a polar bear in a cage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name is Pierre Le Valet,&#8221; said Ambient.
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t lie about it. Skewwett, show Blinders
the handkerchief. I&#8217;ve been sure for some time you
were one of those damn thieves that gouged me in
Pawis. Now I know it by your looks and by that
name. You&#8217;ve behaved like a blackguard to-day,
and I&#8217;m going to lick you, if I can, on the spot. You
know, Blinders, what the fellow has been doing here&mdash;cheating
evewybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take off your coat, Mr. Le Valet,&#8221; said
Blinders, &#8220;and thank your stars you&#8217;ve one gentleman
to thrash you and another to stand by and see
you&#8217;re not killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detected blackleg made a treacherous rush at
Ambient, furious and intending to try some shabby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
trick of a <i>savate</i>, but a solid one, two smote his
countenance and floored, or rather, turfed him.
As he did not come up to time, Ambient took
from Blinders a light Malacca joint and wallopped
the skulking wretch until he began to scream for
mercy. By this time, the facial one, two had developed
into two ugly black eyes. &#8220;Hot nubbless&#8221;
was unpresentable, and Peter and Blinders led him
off to a boat and sent him away, swearing vengeance
spitefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can he do, Peter?&#8221; asked Blinders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harm, I&#8217;m afraid, to someone,&#8221; replied Peter,
thinking how he had come into possession of the
handkerchief and doubting much whether he had
done right to show it. &#8220;What shall we say of his
absence&mdash;that perfidious Albion and proud Gallia
had a contest as to who was victor at Waterloo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done with Monsieur De
Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant?&#8221; asked Mrs. Budlong, looking
sharply at the two, as they walked back.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had a bad head,&#8221; replied Peter innocently,
&#8220;and thought he would be better at home. We have
charged ourselves with his excuses.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the banquet, Clara and Diana, with the two
other members of their quartette, had retired apart
from the crowd. It was almost sunset. They had
chosen a vantage point of vision just at the summit
of a soft slope, commanding the old fort and the bay.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
The boats lay picturesquely grouped in front. The
wash of waves sent up a pleasant, calming music.
They were alone, except when some promenading
couple passed at the distance. Paulding was lying
half-hid by the short sweet-fern bushes, smoking
lazily. Clara was near him. Diana and Dunstan
were at a little distance, so that a slight modulation
of the voice made conversation joint or separate.
Diana had been the gay one thus far; but now the
pensiveness of evening seemed to quiet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sky and water and those mossy rocks remind
me of Mr. Kensett&#8217;s pictures,&#8221; Clara said.
&#8220;He seems to have been created to paint Newport
delightfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather Newport for him to paint,&#8221; corrected
Diana, &#8220;as the world was made for man, the immortal.
Besides, Mr. Kensett is not narrowed to
Newport for his subjects. I notice that so many of
you who know him speak of him by his prenom.
Only very genial men are so fortunate as to be
treated with this familiarity, even by their friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is indeed genial&mdash;one of the men whose
personal, apart from his artistic life, is for the sunny
happiness of those who know him. Apropos of
prenoms, Miss Clara,&#8221; continued Dunstan, &#8220;pray
what melodious, terminal syllables belong to your
father&#8217;s initial, W.? G. W.&mdash;his G. is George, I
know. His W. is what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an old family name,&#8221; replied Clara;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
&#8220;Whitegift. My father is fond of genealogy and
traces the name to a relative, a Bishop Whitegift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An odd name,&#8221; said Dunstan. &#8220;I seem to have
heard it before. Ah, now I recollect having read in
some old family manuscript that my ancestor, Miles
Standish, had some feud with a Pilgrim of that
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara laughed. &#8220;You must talk with Mr. Ira
Waddy. He has a legend that the first Waddy,
Whitegift by name, was cook of the <i>Mayflower</i>, and
that there grew a feud between him and Miles
Standish. The cook put too little pepper in the
hero&#8217;s porridge. Hence an abiding curse, which
Mr. Waddy says depressed his branch of the family
until his time. He represents the democratic side of
our history. My father rather scoffs at the legend.
I must tell him the odd confirmation of it from you.
It will shock his aristocratic feelings terribly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! for the legend,&#8221; said Dunstan. &#8220;Your
ancestors, fair lady, were gods and goddesses of
other realms than those dusky and too savoury ones
where cooks do reign supreme. But I cannot permit
my ancestor&#8217;s curse to rest longer upon you. In my
capacity as his representative, in eldest line, I wave
my hand. The curse is revoked, nay, changed
to a blessing. The old feud is at an end. It
will never be revived between us. We shall never
quarrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said Clara, and turning away abruptly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
she renewed her conversation with Paulding
apart.</p>

<p>&#8220;You accent the &#8216;we,&#8217;&#8221; said Diana, &#8220;as if you
could imagine yourself quarrelling with other
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he; &#8220;why not? But women have always
the advantage of us in a quarrel. We can
compel a man traitor or wrong-doer to pistol or
rifle practice. If he shirks, he becomes a colonist of
Coventry. But a woman shelters herself behind her
sex and dodges the duello. There ought to be a code
of honour for them also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is&mdash;in the hearts of the honourable,&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! but who are they? How are we to
know them, except by those very tests that we cannot
apply until falseness and dishonour on the
woman&#8217;s part will be to us the cause of bitter wrong,
such as a man should pay us with his life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you would challenge the gay deceiver to
mortal combat? Weapons, a fan against a pocket-comb,
across a skein of sewing-silk. Hail! O Attila!
scourge of Flirtationdom! Newport will be
depopulated when your plan prevails.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Depopulated of gay deceivers and their victims.
You and I, Miss Clara and Paulding, would be left
to weep over the slain and strew their graves with
old bouquet leaves. But pity the sorrows of the
young heroes, murdered now and unavenged, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
their murderesses sing their siren song to annual
freshmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do your freshmen listen to siren
songs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Freshmen love music and are unfamiliar with
sirens. And even men no longer so fresh, who have
been forced to hear sorrowful songs, may mistake
siren song for angel song. Harmony is so rare and
so heavenly. We hear it one day, and land. We
meet no chilling reception; the siren sings on sweetly.
The dewy violet and the thornless rose are still worn
and the young heart or the weary heart has but one
word more of passion to say. The third and last
degree of lovers&#8217; lessons waits to be taken, lip to lip.
But&mdash;<i>Halte l&agrave;!</i> &#8216;Will you walk out of my parlour?&#8217;
says the spider to the fly. &#8216;Certainly, fair tarantula,
since you insist upon it.&#8217; Another freshman is on
the threshold, or another not-so-very-fresh may be
wooed into the web. Continue, pretty dear, your
wanton wiles. Sing away, Siren, seeming angel.
We are out. <i>Adieu!</i>&#8221; and Dunstan, whose cigar
was smoked to the thick, drew an immense puff and
breathing out a perfect ring, deposited it upon his engagement
finger. He held up his hand, while the
smoke slowly drifted away in the still, warm air.</p>

<p>Diana laughed. &#8220;Very well done, the ring and
the description. But the termination was rather too
contemptuous for the poetry of the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Contempt is not a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
feeling. I supposed myself too old to express, if not
to have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you mean your history,&#8221; asked Diana, &#8220;for
the epitaph of a dead love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dead love? No! Diana, no! It was the <i>hic
jacet</i> on the cenotaph of a hundred buried flirtations&mdash;my
own and other men&#8217;s. Not all of them can
chisel the inscription as coolly as I do, nor be as indulgent
as I am to the memory of the names inscribed.
But love! Love is undying!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this, they heard a little rustle and a
sigh near them. They turned. It was Miss Milly
Center. She had heard, perhaps, all the conversation.
She rose and seemed about to speak, but her
effort ended in something like a sob, and two rather
well-made tears started and overran her cheeks.</p>

<p>Just then a cheerful voice came over the hill:
&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Susannah! don&#8217;t you cry for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;
and a very shiny glazed hat with a black ribbon,
such as is some men&#8217;s ideal of &#8220;the thing&#8221; for a
head-piece at a water-party, appeared. This hat
was on the top of Billy Dulger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was looking for you, Miss Milly,&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;and wondering where you had wandered to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad you have found me,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to be third in either of these
duos.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had whisked away her tears before she turned
to answer Billy Dulger&#8217;s hail, and now with a smile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
she took his arm and walked away. But it was not
a very happy smile.</p>

<p>Clara and Paulding had not perceived her presence
until Dulger appeared; they were too distant to
hear the conversation just interrupted, or to observe
her confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Miss Center recognised herself in the
heroine of your tale,&#8221; said Diana. &#8220;Do you know
the hero? It must have happened long ago. I
think you have made Mr. Dulger&#8217;s fortune. He has
been a faithful swain, I hear. So you think that,
though flirtations may, love cannot die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Diana,&#8221; he began, and it was the second time he
had addressed her thus. He paused; the sun had
just set. A flash and burst of white smoke shot
from the ramparts of Fort Adams, across the strait.
It was the sunset gun. A great, massive, booming
crash came over the water, and then, eagerly, tumultuously
chasing it, a throng of echoes followed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;O love, they die in yon rich sky,</div>
<div class="verse">They faint on hill or field or river:</div>
<div class="verse">Our echoes roll from soul to soul,</div>
<div class="verse">And grow forever and forever.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Diana,&#8221; continued Dunstan, &#8220;let us walk a
little.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went on for a few steps in silence, her arm
in his. They had not noticed the direction they took,
and these few steps brought them over the crest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
above the banqueting spot. Several of the party
were gathered about Mrs. Wilkes and aiding her in
arranging for return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Mr. Dunstan,&#8221; cried Mrs. Wilkes, catching
sight of him as he was turning back. &#8220;You are
just the person I wanted to select Mrs. Wellabout&#8217;s
forks and Mrs. Skibbereen&#8217;s spoons. No! no! I
can&#8217;t excuse you. Young men must make themselves
useful at my picnics. You&#8217;ve had the belle
long enough. She must be tired of you by this time.
I understand what it means when ladies bring their
cavaliers back to the chaperon&#8217;s neighbourhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunstan half uttered an ugly Spanish oath.
Diana, half-hearing, gave him a reproving look.
Belden and another gentleman approached and
Dunstan was dragged off to identify spoons and
forks. He recognised all his obligations to Mrs.
Wilkes, and did his best to help that busy lady
through her embarrassments with clumsy servants.
He did not even break plates and dishes. Men who
have had their California or frontier experience,
understand themselves in crockery and cookery.
Still, at this moment, he would have preferred not to
be so useful.</p>

<p>And now Mrs. Wilkes, like a wise mother of an
errant brood, began to sound her homeward notes
of recall. The roll of the party began to complete
itself. Someone asked, &#8220;Where is Diana?&#8221;
Where, indeed?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>&#8220;I saw her walking off alone towards the Dumplings
some time ago,&#8221; Gyas Cutus said. &#8220;I asked if
she wanted a companion and she said no&mdash;so I
thought I wouldn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go and look for her, Mr. Dunstan,&#8221;
said the chaperon, &#8220;as payment for your industry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunstan sprang up and <i>non scese, no, precipit&ograve;</i>
down the hillside. Clara looked anxiously after
him. These were the saddening moments of twilight,
when sunset glories are gloom and we are not
yet quite reconciled to night. Some one of the
festal party said that the evening was ominously
beautiful&mdash;it seemed there could never be another to
compare with it. Splendours were exhausted.</p>

<p>The Dumplings stands upon a low, craggy hillock
at the water&#8217;s edge. In front is a bit of precipice;
then a scarped slope, covered with d&eacute;bris, such as
bricks, stones, broken bottles, sardine boxes, and
chicken bones; then rocks again and water. On the
landward side the rough hillock is still steep, but
overcome by a path circling the crumbling round of
the fort. This path is rather up and down, enough
so to blow most dowagers and duennas; the ascent
has therefore its great uses in the world, and many
a tender word has been gasped from panting hearts
of those who panted up together, eluding, for precious
moments, the stern duenna below.</p>

<p>Dunstan climbed rapidly up. It was but a few
steps, yet in the moment all that had ever passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
between him and Diana came powerfully back, as all
the sounds of a lingering storm are suddenly embodied
in one neighbour thunder-clap, and all its
playfully terrible lightnings, illuminating scenes far
away, concentre in the keen presence and absence of
the flash that strikes near by. The evening, whose
ominous beauty had impressed him also, was so still
that he could hear gushes of gay laughter from the
party. He could see nothing of Diana. She must
be within the fort. As he stepped along the narrow
ledge of the pathway, he checked himself an instant
before entering the ruined gateway, and called
&#8220;Diana!&#8221; No answer! Could she have gone elsewhere?
He sprang within the inclosure.</p>

<p>Diana was there. She sat leaning against an
angle of the crumbling wall. As he entered, she
turned towards him a ghastly and agonised face.
She did not stir. She was pressing her handkerchief
to her arm. He was at her side in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blood! blood again!&#8221; he said, with a dreadful
shudder. &#8220;It shall not part us now&mdash;Diana, my
love! my love!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her very tenderly in his arms. Blood was
flowing freely from a wound in her arm. He tore
off his cravat and checked the flow and was binding
the place with his handkerchief. The agonised look
on her face changed to a smile of gentleness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this is nothing&mdash;a scratch&mdash;I
fainted and fell. That was the old wound. I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
dying with the old wound. Dying to-day, when I
was happy again&mdash;to-day, when I know you love
me still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love you&mdash;oh, Diana! I have been waiting
through all this long despair for this one moment.
I knew the terror must pass away that separated us,
and now a new terror comes&mdash;the old wound&mdash;dying&mdash;no!
no! Oh, my God!&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew back and looked at her. There was no
dreary ghastliness in her pallor. He took her in his
arms again for one long, lover kiss&mdash;one long kiss of
life to life and soul to soul. In that kiss all their
old hopes were fulfilled; all their old confidence came
back again; all doubt and hesitation were gone forever.
Fate, that was so cruel to them, forgave them
again. The old terror between them had slowly
sunk away, like a vanishing, ghostly dream,&mdash;vanishing
as light of heaven grows strong and clear over
the soul. The blood that they knew of on each
other&#8217;s hands was washed and worn away, flowing
no longer between, a dark line, narrow but deep as
the river of death.</p>

<p>They had riven their last embrace long ago, because
a death, bloody and terrible, beheld them with
dead, chilling eyes. Even that last embrace, with all
its passionate despair, seemed a sacrilege, a repeated
parricide. What if the murder was no murder?
Then there was the dead. There, studying them
with staring eyes, staring beyond them into an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
eternity of vengeance. Was that a place for love&#8217;s
endearments? For tenderness dear and delicate?
No! no! depart! Fly, lover! Seek thy saddest
exile! Crush thy dear, dear longings! Forget! ah,
yes, forget! That guiltless crime they knew of
severed them. Go! Let this impossible love be
crushed or forgotten.</p>

<p>Crushed! Forgotten! These despot words are
uttered easily; but all the while they know their
futileness. Stronger grows mightiness until it has
prevailed. And love is the strongest strength. This
is the permanent and uncontrollable victor, stronger
than death.</p>

<p>But slowly for these lovers the sense of their guiltlessness
overcame the awe of crime. Heaven pardons
ah! things more guilty far, than their unhappy
and bewildered innocence. They saw pardon rising
over them, pale but hopeful as the twilight of dawn.
And when this pardon overspread their hearts, like
the throbbing violet of daybreak, and the pardoned
lovers met, how could they know that parting had
not done its common work? All common loves are
slain by separation. So these two lovers stood
apart; each ignorant whether Heaven had been generous
to the other of its gift of pardon, and each unwilling,
as proud souls may be, to hold the other to
old pledges and perhaps detested bonds. Apart, but
approaching surely; until the pleasant, meaning
playfulness of picnic talk, and the fateful apparition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
of the flirt, and the chance confession of an old,
half-forgotten folly, had revealed to them, clear as
their hopes had been, the certainty of their love, unchanged,
unchangeable, eternal, infinite.</p>

<p>He had taken Diana in his arms again. Her hurt
was surely not grave, a cut upon her arm as she
fainted and fell. But again another spasm of paling
agony passed over her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old wound,&#8221; she said despairingly. &#8220;I am
fainting again. Take me to Clara.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted her&mdash;she, so dying as it seemed&mdash;he so
strong in his heart&#8217;s agonies of death.</p>

<p>He did not note it then, but he remembered long
afterward, that as he passed from the fort, the moon
was rising pale and solemn, through the dull, leaden
blush, reflected from sunset upon the misty east.</p>

<p>The gay picnic party had hardly observed Dunstan&#8217;s
brief absence. Clara was watching the fort,
and as Dunstan issued with his burden, she ran
wildly down the slope. She met them at the foot of
the escarpment. Dunstan had found himself staggering
at the last few steps and was resting, kneeling
by Diana. Clara knelt by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear sister,&#8221; said Diana, unclosing her eyes,
and seeming to revive at her presence. She made a
feeble movement with her wounded arm. &#8220;It is
nothing, dear Clara. But I am suffering from the
old pain. Forgive me that I concealed something.
I could not tell you all. Now I can, for I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
found my old unchanged love. We will rest here a
moment. I grow stronger. Perhaps I can walk to
the boats. Harry, tell her all our sad story. Dear
Clara!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunstan, in a few quick full words, gave Clara the
history of their love and their parting. Clara listened,
divining much with eager interpretation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Diana! Who could have been strong to
bear this?&#8221; said she. &#8220;Why could you not let me
comfort you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said Diana, &#8220;that there was to be
comfort for me nevermore, until Miss Sullivan was
my angel of pardon. Oh, how wise and good she
is! My mother&mdash;our mother, dear sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>The unwilling, almost unconscious coldness that
had withdrawn Clara from her friend, had utterly
passed away. It shamed her now like a crime, that
uncontrollable passion had made her an unacknowledged,
unperceived rival. But the harm was done,
and she must know it bitterly in her heart and endure
silently. She kissed Diana tenderly, desolately, and
gave her hand to Dunstan. They felt the tenderness:
they could not see the desolation.</p>

<p>Paulding, who had been at the boats, bestowing
paraphernalia, now appeared, and learning from the
party that something was wrong, he came swinging
down the slope with giant strides.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can walk now,&#8221; said Diana. &#8220;To-day speak
to Mr. Paulding and the others only of my fall and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
the cut; that explains itself. The rest by-and-by,&#8221;
and she smiled hopefully with that beautiful smile,
sadder than tears to those who behold it and know
the hopelessness of its deceiving consolation.</p>

<p>Paulding came up, followed by Sir Comeguys.
Both showed great concern at the accident. Diana
thanked them and said that she hoped it was only
trifling, though a shock at first. She then walked
slowly to the boats, clinging to Dunstan&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>Everyone was in such consternation at Diana&#8217;s
accident that she made efforts to recover her usual
spirits and partly succeeded. Good Mrs. Wilkes
must not be mortified by a calamity at her picnic.
All the men who did not venture to be in love with
Diana, or who loved elsewhere, liked her, and the
ladies were not jealous of so unconscious a belle.
She had breadths of sympathy. Miss Milly Center,
Queen of the Birthday Festival, came and took
Diana&#8217;s hand softly and was very sorry. And when
Diana thanked her gently, poor Milly, on her gay
birthday, burst into tears.</p>

<p>In Miss Milly&#8217;s walk with Mr. Dulger, she had
been very exasperating. There was no object she
carried that she did not drop, and few that she did
not break or tear. Poor Billy was put terribly in
fault by her conduct. He could not endure it another
day, and when Milly finally crashed her parasol
into a bag of silk filled with comminuted whale-bone,
and said, &#8220;You must have it mended to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
before eleven, Mr. Dulger, and bring it to me,&#8221;
he resolved to make the morrow&#8217;s morn the crisis.
It should end for better or for worse, for richer or
for poorer, his dumb thraldom. He would kick
away the platform and be a dangler no more, even if
he broke his neck. Courage, Billy Dulger!</p>

<p>Mr. Belden was especially distressed at the accident.
In fact, he seemed, in speaking to Clara, to
assume a right to more than friendly sympathy.
Clara observed, now for the first time, that singular
resemblance between him and Dunstan. She saw
why Diana had allowed an intimacy.</p>

<p>Clara, studying Belden&#8217;s face, quickly and keenly,
discovered that the resemblance was not a pleasant
one. All her old distrust of him returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do not speak of it to-day, Mr. Belden,&#8221;
she thought proper to say to him, &#8220;but you will be
glad to know that Diana and your friend, Mr. Dunstan,
are engaged. It is an old affair revived. It
began in Texas a long time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belden, with his usual self-possession, said what
was friendly and commonplace on such occasions.
Clara was almost deceived. She could not hear the
monosyllable he sent out with a blast, as he turned
toward Mrs. De Flournoy.</p>

<p>Admiral Mrs. Wilkes re-embarked her party for
the moonlight sail. Except Diana&#8217;s accident, which
that lady made light of to the happy chaperon,
everything had gone on and off most prosperously.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
It was whispered that Titania had accepted Mr.
Nicholas Bottom, the millionaire; and poor Cinderella,
whom the hostess feared might be neglected,
had been walking all day and picking buttercups
with Mr. Oberon, the genius.</p>

<p>So with the faint breeze of a silent night of summer,
they drifted across the bay, away along the
path of moonlight. Song and gay hail and answer
passed from boat to boat of the flotilla. Delicious
night! Happy world! Fortunate Miss Milly Center,
with such a joyous birthday! Kind Mrs.
Wilkes! Universal success! Huzza!</p>

<p>At the Millard, Mr. Waddy and Peter Skerrett
found Mr. Budlong just arrived. He came up to
them with his now anxious manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That beggar of a Frenchman has come home
pretty well bunged up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He has sent
word that he wants to see me. I wish you would go,
Peter, my boy, and talk to him. I can&#8217;t guess what
it means. If he wants to borrow money, lend
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Budlong came in with Belden. She gave her
husband a couple of fingers of welcome. Millard&#8217;s
band was playing and she, with several other untiring
females, organised a hop.</p>

<p>Peter Skerrett went off to see De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant.
It was late when he came down. He found Mr.
Waddy waiting on the piazza, his cigar oddly lurid
in the mosquitoless moonlight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>&#8220;He makes conditions,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;the infernal
shabby wretch! He says if they don&#8217;t give him
Miss Arabella, he&#8217;ll expose Mrs. Budlong. He pretends
to have proofs; and I&#8217;m sorry to say that I
fear he has them. I could have beaten him to death,
the contemptible cuss! if he hadn&#8217;t been lying there
in bed, sick and swelled like a pumpkin. He can&#8217;t
show to-morrow and we shall have all day to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll sell out, won&#8217;t he, Peter?&#8221; asked Mr.
Waddy. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t contributed to foreign missions
yet, and here&#8217;s an opportunity. We&#8217;ll try and
arrange it to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunstan called late at Mr. Waddie&#8217;s. Clara saw
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diana is doing well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We will have
good hope,&#8221; and in her fair beauty by the moonlight
she seemed to him an angel of hope. He could not
see her tears as she turned away and fled from him,
and from herself, to Diana&#8217;s bedside.</p>

<p>All night he walked and wandered on the cliffs,
watching the light in Diana&#8217;s window. Sometimes
he thought he saw another figure wandering like
himself; but always when he approached, he found
some uncertain deceptive object, shrub or rock. He
was alone in the moonlight, with his memories, his
hopes, his despairs. Alone in the wide world with
his love. Dying? No! He would not interpret
thus the melancholy fall of waves.</p>

<p>Mr. Belden was rather late that night. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
been walking somewhere with Mrs. Budlong&mdash;very
late somewhere with Mrs. Budlong; he sat in his
room reflecting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; said he again. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost the Diana
chance, whether she meant to cheat me or not.
Well, I&#8217;m sure of my bet on the race; and if the
worst comes to the worst, I&#8217;m glad to know that
Betty Bud has some money of her own. I&#8217;m sure
of her. That job is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am afraid Belden was becoming a very vulgar
ruffian. He had very soon, in coarser amours,
drowned his first disappointment for the loss of
Diana.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<span class="small">CHIN CHIN AND PETER SKERRETT SEIZE THE FORELOCK<br />
OF OPPORTUNITY</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MR. DULGER arose in the morning dull and
early. He stood several hours over the industrious
prol&eacute;taire who was mending Miss Center&#8217;s
parasol. Meantime Billy smoked weak cigars, pulled
at his sporadic moustache, and studied at a formula
of words he meant to use, but would forget.</p>

<p>At eleven, he might have been seen walking in
Millard&#8217;s halls, uneasily, with a neat parasol in hand.</p>

<p>At 11.03, Miss Millicent descended Jacob&#8217;s Ladder
equipped for a walk. She was evidently oblivious
of her appointment, and taking no notice of
poor Dulger at the lower turn of his beat, she turned
into the parlour and sat there quite alone, playing
with her gloves. Surely she was waiting for someone.</p>

<p>Trepidatingly Dulger approached&mdash;&mdash; When
they returned from their walk, an hour afterward, it
was announced, proclaimed, thundered, through
Millard&#8217;s and through Newport, that Miss Center
and Mr. Dulger were engaged. Bulletins to that
effect were dispatched to postoffices from the Aroostook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
to the Rio Grande, as members of Congress say.
Billy telegraphed to his friend, the bookkeeper, to
send a thousand-dollar diamond ring from Tiffany&#8217;s
by express; it came, and glittered on her finger that
evening at the hop. Billy&#8217;s investment for the ring
was one-tenth of one per cent. on her million, and,
<i>certes</i>, was not extravagant. Rich Milly! Poor
Milly! Poor Dulger! Rich Dulger! Poor, rich
Mr. and Mrs. Dulger!&mdash;the man never forgetting
his long and sulky apprenticeship&mdash;the woman, unapproached
any more by exhilarating flirtations, and
never forgetting that her yielding was part compunction
and part pis-allerage. So ends the Billy-dulgerid.</p>

<p>Dunstan came down to inquire about to-morrow&#8217;s
race. Mr. Waddy begged him not to withdraw, unless
Diana&#8217;s condition should be critical. No one
else could ride Pallid. Peter Skerrett, in search of
Mr. Waddy, came up and mentioned the new engagement.
No one was surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was as sure as shooting,&#8221; said Gyas Cutus.
&#8220;He treed her. I gaads! I knew she&#8217;d have to
come down. He&#8217;s been lamming her with bouquets
ever since she came out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; says Peter, &#8220;she has come down in
a shower of gold, reversing the fable of <i>Danae</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no fable about the million,&#8221; said Cloanthus.
&#8220;I wonder if Billy would lend me a V on
the strength of it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a case of <i>d&eacute;pit amoureux</i>,&#8221; whispered
to Dunstan, Peter Skerrett, penetrating sage.</p>

<p>Dunstan said nothing, and presently walked off.
This gossip was distressing to him; he could only
think of his love regained, his love perhaps dying.
He must not see her that day. Absolute repose was
necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old wound,&#8221; he thought; &#8220;the old wound,&#8221;
and thinking of it, he shuddered again.</p>

<p>Peter Skerrett took Mr. Waddy&#8217;s arm, and
walked him away to a quiet corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That damned scoundrel of a Frenchman
wouldn&#8217;t accept your proposition,&#8221; he began. &#8220;He
said it was wealth for him, but the infernal coxcomb
also said he wanted to range himself and become
a virtuous man, and a happy father of a family. He
must have the &#8216;fair Arabella, whom he loved and
whom he believed was secluded from him by the
decree of a harsh parent&#8217;; some such stuff he uttered
and then blew a kiss from his bruised, swelled lips.
Faugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy echoed the exclamation; he shared in
all Peter&#8217;s disgust, and all his anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky,&#8221; continued Peter, &#8220;he can&#8217;t come
out to-day. Everyone&#8217;s inquiring about the row,
and Sir Comeguys says he will only keep still until
the fellow is out of bed and able to speak for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Waddy, as Peter paused again,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
&#8220;what&#8217;s to be done? Is that all the scoundrel
said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a blamed sight; but it&#8217;s so damned unpleasant
I hate to repeat it. After refusing your
offer, he repeated his threat of exposing Mrs. B.,
and he gave me details. He said he wanted to see
her, and if he sent a waiter, she would have to come.
I knew that would never do, so I bullied him a little
and said I would see her myself. By Jove! think
what a box I was getting into. Mrs. B. is cool;
perhaps I may as well put it, brassy. She was complimentary
enough to say that she was surprised a
man of my experience should listen to the idle talk
of a man bruised and angry; that possibly Arabella
(blinking entirely the question, as touching herself&mdash;I
had stated his threat as delicately as I could)
had given him so much encouragement as to persuade
him he had rights. Very probably, for she
herself had hoped that he and Arabella would make
a match, and still hoped it. As to the slanders of
that young brute of an Englishman, they were pure
jealousy. She was satisfied of De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant&#8217;s
position, and thought his abuser a vile coward for
profiting by his personal strength to put a rival out
of the way. She would talk over the matter with
Arabella and see me in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Waddy encouragingly, as Peter
paused again, choked with rage. He rather wondered
at Peter&#8217;s emotion, for that gentleman usually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
held himself well in hand&mdash;but then this was an extraordinary
case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Peter, &#8220;in an hour, I happened
to pass through the corridor. Arabella, cried
to a perfect jelly, was just opening the door for her
mother. How the harridan must have been bullying
that poor girl! And yet she was as cool, and smiling,
and handsome, as if she was coming out of
St. Aspasia&#8217;s after her Sunday afternoon nap. She
said she had found a little proper ladylike hesitation
on the part of Miss Arabella; that young ladies
did not like this courting by proxy; and that she
had no doubt that when De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant was able
to plead his own cause, that her daughter&#8217;s long-existing
inclination for him would develop immediately
into the desirable degree of affection. By
Jove! I couldn&#8217;t help admiring the woman as she
stood and told me all this, perfectly self-possessed,
though she knew I believed it was every word a lie.
Then she said that, as I was quite the confidential
friend of the family, she would ask me to go with
her to M. De Ch&acirc;teaun&eacute;ant. And I went! What do
you think of that, Waddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think,&#8221; answered Ira.
&#8220;And yet it was probably the best thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I thought,&#8221; agreed Peter. &#8220;She sat down
by the beggar&#8217;s bedside and told him, by Jove! that
she thought he needed a little motherly sympathy;
that she had always looked with great favour upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
his suit for her daughter, and that she hoped and
had no doubt the young lady would smile upon him.
She could promise it, in fact, after an interview this
morning. I tell you, Waddy, she took my breath
away. I could have screamed with laughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy grimly. &#8220;How
did the farce end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ended with a few minutes&#8217; earnest whispering
on the part of the lady. Then she got up triumphantly,
and that blackguard turned his ugly
swollen face towards me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Monsieur Skarrette,&#8217; he said, in his dirty,
broken English, &#8216;I veel vate faur ze promesse auf
Mees Arabella teele aftare to-morrah. I veel not be
anie maur cheete. Ef she do not agree, I sall tale all
to Meestare Buddilung.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Peter, &#8220;I was white hot&mdash;I
don&#8217;t think I shall be ever quite so angry again&mdash;I
certainly hope not. I think Mrs. B. saw it and
feared some further injury to the Gaul, for she said
good-bye hastily and carried me away with her.
Out in the hall, she turned to me again, cool as a
cucumber.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You see he is quite reasonable,&#8217; she said, with
amazing impudence, &#8216;though naturally rather ardent
for his object. We are much obliged to you,
Mr. Skerrett.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She gave me her hand and the only sign of emotion
she showed in the whole interview was to grasp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
mine like a vice. A few minutes afterward, I saw
Belden help her into his buggy and they drove off
together. Do you suppose it possible that she meditates
some escapade with him? Of course all this
couldn&#8217;t be told to poor old Flirney; he should be
saved, if possible. But I could not bear to think of
Arabella being the victim of such an infernal plot,
without a friend. The matter had gone too far for
ceremony, so I went up and knocked at her door.
There is so much of that familiarity going on, that I
supposed no one would notice it. She opened the
door and, when she saw me, burst into tears. I felt
so sorry for the poor child that I couldn&#8217;t help&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you did, did you?&#8221; interrupted Ira, seeing
a great light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did; and she shall be Mrs. Peter Skerrett,
if her step-mother is a&mdash;&mdash; She shall, by Jove!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter, you&#8217;re the king of trumps!&#8221; cried Mr.
Waddy, and held out his hand. &#8220;And, by curry!
you deserve to be congratulated. She&#8217;s a nice girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is!&#8221; agreed Peter, with conviction. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
known it a long time. Well, to return, the poor
thing was actually bewildered with terror. She said
that she liked the fellow well enough at first&mdash;you
know he has the talents of an adventurer&mdash;he flattered
her and led her on, always speaking French,
until he had got up a great intimacy. Then Mrs.
Budlong,&mdash;she no longer called her mother,&mdash;began
to persuade her to accept him, and then to treat the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
matter as settled; and then to bully her and say that
her honour was engaged, and her character would
be gone if she did not marry him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imagine the poor girl, so young, and totally uneducated
to think for herself, in the grasp of that
infernal crocodile! Then her brother, that mean
little squirt, Tim, made some heavy gambling debts
to the Frenchman, and he told her he thought the
marriage was just the thing, and wouldn&#8217;t listen to
a word from her. Mrs. Budlong said that her father
had given his full approval to the match. Arabella
felt utterly abandoned, and I do believe that horrid
hag would have carried her point before this, if Ambient
hadn&#8217;t stepped in with his timely licking. At
the picnic the Frenchman was continuing to treat
her with tyrannical familiarity. She hated him so
much that she longed to go to Diana and Clara for
protection, but she feared they would think her a
silly little snob and send her to her mother.
Mother!&#8221; repeated Peter with emotion, and swallowed
hard.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy also felt an unaccustomed lump in his
gullet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; said he, a little huskily, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of
you. By Jove! I&#8217;m proud to know you. You&#8217;re the
best man in the lot. The rest of us would have stood
around and seen that girl sent to the devil and never
have lifted a finger to prevent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come,&#8221; protested Peter, &#8220;I know better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
than that. And then, besides, you see, you&mdash;you
didn&#8217;t have my incentive. She needed someone,
Waddy; she said she&#8217;d always thought me one of
her best friends&mdash;but she couldn&#8217;t speak to any
gentleman about her troubles, much less me. And
then she began to cry again and I had to kiss her
again like a brother and tell her that I was her best
friend and would save her. Luckily, no one happened
to pass; so I let her sob herself quiet in my
arms and told her to have courage and not to speak
to anyone on this subject. What a damnable infamy
it is! I don&#8217;t care for Mrs. Budlong, and would
let her be exposed and go to the devil, but it will
kill the old gentleman. He&#8217;s a good old boy, and
actually loves that woman. We must save him if
we can. Here is old Mellasys, Saccharissa&#8217;s father;
couldn&#8217;t we get him to kidnap the Frenchman for
a fugitive slave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; said Waddy, &#8220;we may get the Frenchman
off, but there is left behind a man much more
dangerous than any Frenchman&mdash;Belden!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About eight o&#8217;clock that evening, Mr. Waddy
sent Chin Chin to inquire of Diana&#8217;s health. On
his return, Chin Chin made a circuit to a shop he
knew of. His object was lager beer, a washy beverage,
favoured by Chinamen, Germans, and such like
plebeian and uncouth populaces. Feeling sleepy after
his draught, he gradually subsided into a ball and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
sank under the table. Except, perhaps, Box Brown
and Samuel Adams, packed some years ago by John
C. Colt, corner Broadway and Chambers Street, no
being is known, bigger than an armadillo or a
hedgehog, capable of such compact storage as a
slumbering Chinaman.</p>

<p>Chin Chin under the table was therefore not perceived
by two men who came in to get beer and mutter
confidences over it. He, however, waking and
craftily not stirring until he could do so without
disturbing legs endowed with capacity to kick,
heard this secret parley. He could not recognise the
legs, but could the voices.</p>

<p>As soon as he was released, he ran to the Millard,
and gave his message to Mr. Waddy; then, in consequence
of the beer-shop discoveries, he crept along
like a quick snake to his master&#8217;s hired stable. The
night was very dark, the clouds obstructing the
moon. Chin Chin&#8217;s mission and his plan were perfectly
suited to his crafty Malayan nature. He knew
the stable intimately. He had often found it a handy
place to snooze away the effects of beer or gluttony&mdash;larger
and more airy than his usual habitation, and
much less liable to rude invasion. He had prepared
a secret means of ingress and egress; now, after a
quick glance around, he glided along to one corner,
moved a board slightly and crept inside through the
crevice thus revealed.</p>

<p>In the stable were Mr. Waddy&#8217;s three horses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
Pallid stood next to a vacant stall. A roughly contrived
manger, with no division, passed through all
the stalls. The back door of the stable opened upon
a yard, separated by a low fence from a dark lane.
There was a locked door through this fence; both the
stable doors were also locked.</p>

<p>Pallid recognised the Chinaman and whinnied a
welcome nearly as articulate as the other&#8217;s reply.
Chin Chin&#8217;s plan was already laid. He did not
seem to need light to execute it. He groped about
for a billet of wood in a spot he knew of, and drawing
a fine fishing line from his pocket, made it fast
to the billet, which he then threw over a beam running
the length of the stable. He drew the billet up
to the beam by his line, and holding the end, wormed
himself in under a heap of hay that filled the stall
next to Pallid&#8217;s. He found that, without changing
his position, he could pass his hand into the adjoining
manger. It seemed he had a fancy of possible
danger, for he took from his breast pocket a
perilous piratical knife and laid it in the manger at
his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pigeon&mdash;all same&mdash;Hi yah!&#8221; said he, with
gleaming teeth and a grin.</p>

<p>Chin Chin waited, probably dreaming of the Central
Flowery Land and fancying himself under the
shade of his native tea plant, offering a tidbit of rat
pie to the fair Pettitoes in sabots, skewered hair,
talon finger-nails, and brocaded raiment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>His tender, nostalgic reverie was disturbed by the
cautious turning of a key. The door opened and
two men armed with a slide lantern entered. They
drew up the slide and stood revealed, a precious
pair, Belden and Figgins, come to superintend the
training of Pallid for to-morrow&#8217;s race.</p>

<p>They peered cautiously round the stable&mdash;nothing
but horses and hay. They could not see that snake-in-the-grass
watching them with glittering eye and
keen delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must do it quick, Figgy,&#8221; said Belden;
&#8220;give me the ball. You hold the light. Whoa,
Pallid!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped to the stall, and patting Pallid on the
neck, placed a very suspicious-looking horse-ball in
the manger. Pallid was beginning to turn it over
and sniff at it, when&mdash;slam, bang!&mdash;Chin Chin let
go the billet. It crashed to the floor, knocking
down sundry objects with a terrible clatter.</p>

<p>The conspirators started, looked at each other
fearfully, and sprang back as if to escape. The
noise ceasing, they looked about with anxiety.
Belden caught sight of the billet and its effects.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Nothing but a stick of wood
fallen down&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and turned back to the horse.</p>

<p>Meantime, under cover of the noise and panic,
Chin Chin had snatched away the dosed sausage
from Pallid&#8217;s manger, and thrown in a handful of
oats. The horse champed them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>&#8220;The greedy brute has swallowed his pill and is
licking his damned chops,&#8221; Belden announced.
&#8220;Well, you black devil, so much for you for throwing
me, and so much for your master. You won&#8217;t
win any race to-morrow nor this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again examining suspiciously everywhere, they
went out as cautiously as they had entered.</p>

<p>Chin Chin chuckled. He was fond of Pallid and
fond of the turf, a novel fancy for a Chinaman. He
knew if he revealed this adventure to Mr. Waddy,
that the race would come to an end, so far as that
gentleman was concerned, at least. Chin Chin
wanted to see the fun. Unluckily for Figgins, he
had bets with him. Chin Chin determined to consider
himself the executive of retribution and keep
his own counsel till after the race. He looked at the
ball; he smelt it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pose good for Chinaman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ebryting
all same pigeon eat em rat; eat em puppy; pose eat
em sossidge. Hi yah! first chop good, all same.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nibbled a little bit, ate a little bit, and then
looking out and finding the coast clear, cautiously
crept homeward in the shadow. As he ate, he
seemed at first very well satisfied, then less satisfied,
and finally not at all satisfied, and throwing away the
remnants of the ball, he made for the Millard, pressing
both his hands on that part of his person which
seemed the centre of dissatisfaction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<span class="small">THE STORY OF DIANA AND ENDYMION</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DIANA was still very ill. They found it necessary
to keep her perfectly quiet. The old
wound, never fully healed, had given her much pain
of late. Mental excitement at the picnic and her fall
had produced feverish symptoms. Her physician had
fears which he hardly ventured to express; which
he hardly dared formulate, even to himself. She
had aroused herself enough during the day to send
a kind message by Clara to Dunstan, and to ask that
they would write to Miss Sullivan to come on.
A letter to that lady would go by the morning mail
to Boston.</p>

<p>Dunstan was in an agony of suspense. During
the day, he tried to distract his fixed madness of
thought by training Pallid over the beach. The
other men were also out on the beach or the road.
Bets were nearly even on Pallid, Knockknees, and
Nosegay. Toward evening, Dunstan mounted his
own horse and galloped off up the island. The wild
sunset and windy drift of torn, black clouds was
such a mood of nature as suited the terror at his
heart. It was a night like this when, in Texas, he
had started from San Antonio to ride sixty miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
across the country and catch his train. There were
such stormy masses of weird clouds, so flashed
through by an August moon, so floating at midnight,
when, as he dashed along the trail, shouting in
savage exhilaration, all the wildness of his nature
bursting forth in mad songs and chants of Indian
war, suddenly his trusty horse, who had borne him
thousands of miles in safety by night and day, over
deserts of dust and wastes of snow, fell with him, on
him, crushing him terribly. And then, by just such
fitful gleams of moonlight, he had dragged himself
desolately along, with unbroken limbs, but mangled
and bleeding&mdash;dragged himself whither he saw a
midnight lamp, as of one who watched the sick or
the dead. And near the spot whence the light came,
he had sunk voiceless, fainting, dying, until he was
awakened by a tender touch upon his brow, and saw
bending over him, in the clear quiet of midnight,
Diana, who had found at last and was to save her
Endymion: Diana, from that moment to become the
passion of his every instinct, the love of every
thought.</p>

<p>But now, now it was she who was the wounded,
the fainted, the dying. O God! he could not think
of this despair, and he cried aloud and galloped on
furiously. The drift of wild black clouds followed
him as he rode and met him more gloomily as he
returned.</p>

<p>He could not rest, and soon resumed his sentinel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
tramp along the shore. There for hours he walked,
the breakers counting his moments drearily. The
horizon all to seaward was a black line, and over it
the sky was lurid blankness; it did not tempt the
voyaging hope to circle ocean, chasing distant dawn.
He could not seek a refuge for his miserable hopelessness
in that reasoning with the infinite called
prayer. Was it to make him happy or content that
men, questioning the infinite and receiving for all
answer, &#8220;Mystery!&#8221; had essayed for themselves to
interpret this dim oracle and had feigned to find
that sorrows and agonies are strengthening blessings?
So the happy and the placid say: so say not
the lonely and bereaved. Pain is an accursed wrong,
for all our self-beguiling and self-flattery in its
lulls.</p>

<p>This was a man of thorough, tested manhood.
There was no experience that educates the body and
the mind which he had not proved. All this preparation
was done; he was facing the duties of his full
manhood. And now that was to happen, that sorrow
he knew must come, which would make every
effort joyless, every achievement a vanity, every belief
a doubt, every day sick for its coming night of
darkness, and every morn sad for its uninvited
dawning and eager for speedy night.</p>

<p>As he moved along the shore, he was aware again,
as on the previous night, of a shadow lurking in
the dimness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>&#8220;Possibly a mischief-maker,&#8221; he thought, and
half-concealing himself, he waited to watch. The
figure approached&mdash;a man. He stepped forward to
meet him in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paulding!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunstan!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two friends had not met since the picnic.
Paulding knew, only as everyone now knew, that
his friend and Diana were engaged. He therefore
could conceive why there was one night wanderer
by the shore. In a few passionate words, he told
Dunstan his own secret&mdash;the secret of his sorrowful
unrest. He, too, loved Diana.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear friend,&#8221; said Dunstan tenderly, as the
other sobbed and was silent, &#8220;I have seemed almost
a traitor to you and if I could have dreamed of this,
I would have even violated my pledge to tell you
before what I now can tell permittedly. I was too
busy with my own happiness in recovering Diana to
think of any other man or woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Recovering her?&#8221; repeated Paulding. &#8220;Then
you had already met&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dunstan, and recounted the incident
of his night ride from San Antonio and his fall.
&#8220;Diana went out upon the lawn,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;to
study the moon, her emblem. She heard my moans.
The noble woman was living there alone with her
mother, once ruined and mad, and now dying.
Her whole household consisted of a few negroes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
two or three Mexican servants. When I awoke
from my fainting fit and found her stooping over
me, I knew in that moment that she was to be the
goddess of my life. Love came upon me like a
revelation. She had me taken to her house, and
herself dressed my wounds and cared for me. You
know her dignity and judgment as a woman of
society, but you may hardly imagine the energy and
skill and contrivance and fearless delicacy she
showed in her treatment of me, as I lay there a perfectly
helpless invalid. I convalesced slowly. We
found that our worlds of society and thought and aspiration
were the same. The circumstances were
what are called romantic. I need not give you the
history of my growing love. You know the woman.
You know the man. It was fate. Anywhere it must
have been the same; there, how doubly certain. I
have never known any being like Diana; fresh and
free and fearless as a savage, and yet the heir of the
beautiful refinements of all chivalric ages. Oh,
Paulding&mdash;when I think of her, as I knew her then,
with a mind and character of an empress, and her
dear tenderness of heart, as I knew her and loved
her then, and shall forever, I cannot let her die!&#8221;</p>

<p>He groaned and was silent for a while. The
melancholy crash of breakers undertoned his story,
and now, as he paused, it filled the interval like the
unpeaceful symphony of some great genius, wasting
itself in doleful music.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>&#8220;Diana had collected in that distant seclusion,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;all the beautiful necessities of elegant
life. We had books and music. Our acquaintance,
friendship, love marched strong and fast. It grew
with my convalescence. It was now admitted love.
She had told me the whole of her mother&#8217;s sad
story. Her mother was dying; in days, weeks, or
months it would be all over. She besought me to
remain and not leave her alone with death. I had
never seen her mother, who was confined entirely
to her bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember that beautiful bowie knife you
gave me in California. One day I was sitting on the
piazza cleaning that and my six-shooter, for the first
time since my fall. I had given the knife an edge
keen as a gleam and was trying it on a chip. Suddenly
Diana ran out to me. Her mother was wild,
she said, almost in convulsions. The old nurse
was terrified to death; would I come quick and
aid them? She was still speaking, when a mad,
ghastly figure, in white, sprang forward and seized
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Devil!&#8217; screamed this maniac, &#8216;you shall not
ruin my child, as you have ruined me,&#8217; and she
stabbed Diana furiously in the side with a knife.
Then she leaped upon me. I had the bowie in my
hand. There was an instant&#8217;s struggle. I felt her
cutting at my neck. I was not aware of using my
weapon, but she stiffened in my arms and sank away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
bloody and wounded. She died there in a moment,
horribly&mdash;she, Diana&#8217;s mother!</p>

<p>&#8220;Diana had fallen fainting, but not unconscious&mdash;she
had seen the whole. I sprang to her. She repelled
me with a look of horror. I was covered with
blood, my own, her mother&#8217;s, hers. I screamed for
help. The old nurse came out, crouching with terror.
Diana dragged herself away, turning back to
give me a glance of utter agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was left alone with the corpse; I washed my
own wounds; they were but trifling. I longed for
death. I seemed to myself an assassin. I set myself
to remove the traces of the struggle. The old nurse
came out and aided me, cowering and shrinking
away as I touched her. We carried the poor, lifeless
body in&mdash;Diana&#8217;s mother, feebly like her daughter.
Diana joined us, pale to death. She gave me her
hand solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Go,&#8217; she said, &#8216;this is between us forever&mdash;between
me and my undying love. I am better.
Do not fear for me. Go. God save and
pardon us. Let this be a secret between us and
Him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I crept away like a guilty man. My horse had
recovered from his sprain; I rode off and left him
with the nearest settler, five miles from her house.
I returned and lurked like a wild beast in the woods.
I saw the funeral. No one was present but her own
people. She was pale, but calm and strong. I must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
fly despairfully, and on my hands the stain of her
mother&#8217;s blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend, the settler, told me as a piece of general
indifferent news that the madwoman up at the
big house had killed herself in a fit. That was the
accepted story and went uncontradicted. Soon
after, I joined you in New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my story. You can imagine the gradual
calming of our minds, as we recognised our real
guiltlessness. You can understand why, to escape
questions, we seemed not to know each other. We
learnt in our daily meetings here that we need not
shrink from a new friendship, and then, by a chance
confidence at the picnic, that our love was unchanged.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, Paulding, forgive this unwilling
reticence of mine. You know what was this old
wound. I fear the worst. But that we will not
speak of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a wide world, Harry,&#8221; said Paulding.
&#8220;There is room in it for many exiles. I shall
find my home for wandering&mdash;somewhere&mdash;anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moon sank away drearily, leaving a ghastly
paleness in the west. And the melancholy breakers,
in darkness now, went on falling, hesitating, lifting,
falling on the black rocks, counting the measures of
a desolate eternity.</p>

<span class="small">IN WHICH MR. BELDEN REACHES THE END<br />
OF HIS ROPE</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Mr. Waddy rang his bell in the morning
after the stable scene, no Chin Chin appeared,
and inquiry developed the fact that Chin
Chin was sick. Ira&#8217;s toilet may, therefore, not have
been quite so accurate as usual, and the polish on his
neat calfskins not so mirrorlike. In fact, he had too
many anxieties crowding around, to concern himself
much with cravat ties and the gleaming boot. He
sent his groom, a Bowery boy, <i>pur sang</i>, to care for
Chin Chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t dangerous, sir,&#8221; that worthy returned
to report, &#8220;but he&#8217;s been a-gulpin&#8217; down suthin&#8217; as
has kicked up a bobbery in his innards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Mr. Waddy; &#8220;have Pallid
ready for eleven o&#8217;clock. How does he look this
morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as gay, sir, as a house afire,&#8221; Bowery assured
him. &#8220;Yer kin bet yer life on it, he&#8217;ll rake
&#8217;em down!&#8221; and Bowery departed, humming cheerfully
to himself, confident of being richer ere the
day was over.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>Major Granby dropped in upon his friend a moment
later.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m losing my interest in this race,&#8221; said Waddy,
&#8220;since Dunstan&#8217;s unwillingness to ride has become
so evident. Poor fellow! I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s very little
hope for Diana.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say so,&#8221; protested Granby; &#8220;the world
cannot spare that noble girl. I was just speaking
with Skerrett of her. He says she is the only woman
he ever knew who is afraid of neither fresh air nor
sunshine. And Clara&mdash;how can that beautiful
friendship be severed? You can hardly imagine
how those sisters have quartered themselves in my
rusty old heart. Did you ever hear them speak of
Miss Sullivan, their governess? She must be a remarkable
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sullivan? No,&#8221; said Waddy, connecting the
name at once with his preserver at The Island. &#8220;A
lady of that name did me a service once. I must ask
them about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunstan will ride without fail, I suppose?&#8221;
asked Granby. &#8220;We must beat that fellow Belden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunstan will hold to his word; if it were to
drive the chariot of Tullia,&#8221; answered Ira, who had
read his friend&#8217;s character aright.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Budlong had an interview with Arabella
early that morning. Arabella looked very tearful,
but there was also a new expression in her face,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
thanks to Peter Skerrett&mdash;one might almost call it
determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear,&#8221; said the step-mother, &#8220;what
shall I say to the lover? He is eager for the kind
word of encouragement,&#8221; and Mrs. De Flournoy
played affectionately with the young lady&#8217;s curls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him I hate him!&#8221; cried the poor penitent,
bursting into tears again. &#8220;I hope, madam, you
will never mention his name to me&mdash;no, not once
more! Oh! oh! you hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The affectionate mamma had given the curls a
little tug.</p>

<p>&#8220;You silly fool!&#8221; said she, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know he
can ruin your prospects? You&#8217;ll offend your father
so that he&#8217;ll discard you, and then what will you do?
If you are so dishonourable and disobedient, when
we are striving for your good, we shall let you go
to the destruction you choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I shall find some friends who will not
think me dishonourable,&#8221; sobbed poor Arabella,
thinking with rueful gratitude and confidence of
honest Peter and his fraternal feelings. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
dishonourable. I&#8217;m trying to do right. I may have
been foolish, but that&mdash;man&mdash;he can&#8217;t be a gentleman,
or he would not persecute me so. I don&#8217;t know
what reason you can have for wanting to make me
miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My reasons are of course wise and judicious,&#8221;
retorted Mrs. B. &#8220;I will see you once more, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
then, if you do not choose to yield, you will be the
cause of the <i>&eacute;clatant</i> scandal of the season. You
won&#8217;t think of going to the race with those red eyes.
I wouldn&#8217;t take you if you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Arabella was the only one who did not go;
everybody went; all that we have encountered in
this history and platoons of others.</p>

<p>The first beach at Newport is straightish, and a
mile or so in length,&mdash;a very long &#8220;or so,&#8221; when
you are dragged over it in the unwilling family
coach, by stagnant steeds&mdash;a very short mile when
the beautiful comrade whose presence is a consecration
and a poet&#8217;s dream, says &#8220;Shall we gallop?&#8221;
and cheats with fleeting transport, as she passes, the
winds from summer seas, that sigh to stay and
dally with her curls.</p>

<p>Between beach number one and beach number two
is an interregnum of up and down, a regency of
dust. Then comes the glorious second beach. You
will hardly see anything more beautiful than this
long, graceful sweep, silvery grey in the sunshine,
with a keener silver dashed along its edge by curving
wave that follows curving wave. You will hardly
see any place gayer than this same wide path beside
the exhilarating dash of the Atlantic, on a gay afternoon
of August&mdash;hundreds of carriages, more or
less well-appointed; scores of riders, more or less
well-mounted or -seated.</p>

<p>Thus, then, to the second beach between grey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
rocks, grey sand slopes, and grey meadows beyond,
and on the other hand the gleaming glory of the sea,
came at eleven that morning, to see the race, all the
snobs and all the nobs. Peter Skerrett and his aides
marshalled them. Mrs. Budlong, alone in her carriage,
bowed and smiled very pleasantly to Peter.
However critical that person may have felt her position,
and whatever desperate resolve she might
entertain for escape, through whatever postern, from
the infamy of public dismissal, she was quite as
usual. No; she was even handsomer than usual,
more quietly splendid in attire, and reclining with
calmer luxuriousness of demeanour on her cushions
of satin.</p>

<p>Among the many traps, drags, and go-carts, of
various degrees of knowingness, Mr. Waddy&#8217;s was
conspicuous. Major Granby, old Budlong, and
Paulding accompanied him. Old Bud said it made
him quite young again to see the boys out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir,&#8221; he added, &#8220;why do they bump on the
outside of a horse, when they might sit and grow
fat in a buggy? There&#8217;s Tim, sir, my boy Tim, is
growing quite thin and haggard; he says riding
don&#8217;t agree with him. I&#8217;m afraid he won&#8217;t do much
with Drummer to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>A straight race, on a dead level, lacks features of
varied brilliancy. Peter Skerrett had arranged that
the field should start alternately from either end,
that all might see alphas and omegas. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
proud and numerous start and the disarrayed and
disappointed finishes might be viewed by all spectators.
All might share the breathless sympathies
of doubts and enthusiasms for the winner.</p>

<p>Peter Skerrett, too busy to think of poor Arabella,
who, in her bower, was thinking much of him and
sighing as she thought how unworthy she had been
in her long education of vanities and follies; Peter
now brought forward his rank of equestrians. The
sea was still, and hardly rustled as it crept along
the sands, unterrifying to horse or man; yet the air
was cool and the sun not too ardent to be repelled by
a parasol.</p>

<p>As the line formed, the ladies chose their champion
men and bet gloves recklessly on them; the
gentlemen chose champion horses, with a view also
to riders, and bet reckfully.</p>

<p>It appeared that Tim Budlong was&mdash;bluntly&mdash;drunk,
and Drummer lost his backers. There was
a murmur of sympathy as Dunstan rode up on Pallid;
sympathy admiring for this pair, a best of the
animal and a best of the man, and sympathy pitiful
for the man of a soul that must bear the anxiety and
perhaps the sorrow that all knew of. A noble fellow
and a generous the common suffrage made him, already
distinguished for bold ability and frank disdain
of cowardice and paltering. When experience
had made him a little more indulgent to the limping
progress and feeble vision and awkward drill of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
mankind, rank and file, he would be a great
popular leader. So thought the Nestors, feeling
themselves fired by the fervours of this young
Achilles.</p>

<p>Belden had overdone his costume, as such men
often do. It was urgent with him to look young; he
achieved only a gaudy autumnal bloom. Knockknees,
<i>malgr&eacute;</i> that ungainly quality of his legs, was
an imposing, masculine style of horse. As he passed,
stopping to speak intimately to Mrs. De Flournoy,
several of the intuitionless women envied that person
and several men called him &#8220;lucky dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blinders was not a lady&#8217;s man. His horse was,
however, one of the favourites. Very few men but
Blinders would have ventured to mount, or even approach,
such a rascal brute. Nosegay knew that his
master was invincible, but he wished to inform him
that they were a pair of invincibles; accordingly,
despising the two snaffles, the one in hand, the other
around the rider&#8217;s waist for steady drag, Nosegay
would fling his head about and then move on without
reference to requests that he tarry or stand at
ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;That there &#8217;oss&#8217;ll overrun &#8217;isself,&#8221; said Figgins
to Mr. Waddy&#8217;s Bowery Boy, with whom he had
bets on Pallid, money up. &#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;ll make a four-mile
&#8217;eat hout of hevery mile &#8217;eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gaaz, Johnny Bull!&#8221; returned the Bowery.
&#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t no hoss in a hide as kin git away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Mr. Blinders. It caan&#8217;t be did. He&#8217;s one er the
bohoys, he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob O&#8217;Link&#8217;s horse was a mare. The sentimental
fellow had named her Lalla Rookh. She was a delicate
beauty, but it was quite evident that her master
would not give himself the trouble to win.</p>

<p>Scalper was so busy caricaturing Billy Dulger
that he was near forgetting to present himself with
Gossoon. Little Skibbereen recalled him to his duty.
Skibby wanted to see his horse go, and could
hardly forgive his mamma for keeping him at her
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I break my neck, ma, if I like?&#8221;
he protested. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go and break it the day I&#8217;m
twenty-one and leave my property to the Tract
Society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Com Ambient said good-naturedly that he
merely started to make one more in the field. This
was clear to the observing eye.</p>

<p>Billy Dulger, having achieved his heart&#8217;s desire,
rode up very unwillingly. The bookkeeper had sent
him on garments much too refulgent for this, or
any occasion. He was rather conspicuous <i>per se</i> as
the Great Accepted of Miss Center. The Billy-dulgerid
epic, having already been brought to its
finale, nothing more need be said of its hero&#8217;s performances
in the race, except that his horse did not
disappoint the stableman, his owner; did not win a
heat; did not start a second time; and that Billy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
hair was full of sand for several days after this
eventful one.</p>

<p>Preparations are of years, acts of moments. To
run a mile takes a minute and so many seconds, disappointingly
brief. Poor, dissolute Tim Budlong,
over-fortified by drink, struck Drummer viciously at
starting. Drummer shied toward the water and Tim
went over his head. Sobered by the plunge, Timothy
mounted the horse, which someone caught, and
disappeared homeward, fully ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>In a minute and so many seconds, a hurrah came
down the wind. Blinders had won; Pallid second;
Knockknees third.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right next time,&#8221; telegraphed Figgins to his
master.</p>

<p>Sir Comeguys had saved his distance handsomely
and now withdrew.</p>

<p>Time was about to be called again. Where was
Blinders? At last he reappeared. Nosegay had
gone on indefinitely and was at last, with difficulty,
persuaded to return.</p>

<p>Off they all go once more. The ladies at the
upper end are almost terrified at this assault of
cavalry. So even seems the front of charge that all
are deemed winners; but the judges announce Pallid
first; Knockknees second; Nosegay third&mdash;all very
close running.</p>

<p>Belden began to be anxious. Instead of drooping,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
Pallid was improving. Had the poison failed? He
superintended the care of his horse most sedulously.
Each of the gentlemen had a groom at either end of
the course. Dunstan grew excited with success.
The match was a very even one. Good riding would
determine it. Bob O&#8217;Link strolled up to Miss
Anthrope&#8217;s carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll win the next heat, if you wish it,&#8221;
said he languidly.</p>

<p>Everyone was astonished at the next announcement
of victory. Lalla Rookh first; Knockknees
second; Pallid and Nosegay third. Blinders kept
Nosegay up, but he was showing the effects of his
stubborn struggles. Belden called Figgins.</p>

<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;ve cheated me; the
horse goes better every time. I only got ahead this
time by Link&#8217;s riding in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi dunno what hit means,&#8221; protested his accomplice.
&#8220;Hif I&#8217;ve cheated you, Hi&#8217;ve cheated
myself. Hevery penny of mine&#8217;s hon it. I &#8217;ope
&#8217;e&#8217;ll drop next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did not drop. There was only half a head
between him and Nosegay, but Pallid won the race
and immense applause. He was victor in the first
regular race ever run on the beach of Newport.
Everyone felt that the occasion was important.</p>

<p>For a moment Belden sat his horse like a man
dazed. He had been falling a long time&mdash;at last
he had come to the ground. He had backed Knockknees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
heavily, besides his bet with Granby. He
could not pay. He knew that his Boston creditors
would be down to attach his horses for Boston
debts; Millard&#8217;s bill of three figures was lying on
his table unpaid.</p>

<p>&#8220;That damned Figgins will blow me,&#8221; he
thought. He cursed Dunstan, winner of the race,
winner of Diana. &#8220;She would have made me a
better man,&#8221; thought he, with a groan of despair.
&#8220;I shall have to retire for a while. Luckily, I&#8217;ve
got hold of someone that I can invite, rather positively,
to go along and pay expenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought nerved him, and he pulled himself
together. He dismounted, gave his horse to his
supplemental groom, and looking with a pleasant
scowl around, walked up to Mrs. Budlong&#8217;s carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find it rather warm, now that the race is
over,&#8221; said that person. &#8220;Will you get in and drive
home with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>So they drove off in very handsome style, admired
by the admiring, envied by the envious. Mrs. Budlong
complained of a headache, and kept her room
the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Wellabout drove Dunstan away. They stopped at
Mr. Waddie&#8217;s. Diana would see her betrothed to-day.
His heart sank at the announcement. There
was, indeed, no hope; she must die; slowly, sadly,
after many days of lingering adieux, and all that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
divine beauty be no more seen and felt to inspire
and to consecrate her neighbour world.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy, Major Granby, and Peter Skerrett
returned at ten that evening from dining at the
Skibbereens&#8217;. Old Budlong met them in the hall,
and they all went up to Mr. Waddy&#8217;s parlour for a
cigar.</p>

<p>Chin Chin had reappeared, looking as unwholesome
as a cold buckwheat cake. Retribution for his
reticence had overtaken him. He began to tell Ira
his story of the stable scene in his odd, broken
English. While he was so doing, there was a knock
at the door. A woman, Miss Arabella&#8217;s maid, to
see Mr. Skerrett, and the Bowery Boy for Mr.
Waddy.</p>

<p>Ira interpreted Chin Chin&#8217;s tale to the other
gentlemen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Bowery Boy, who had waited
with the imperturbableness of his class, &#8220;if somebody
tried t&#8217; pizen the hoss afore, it must be the same
chap as has did it now. I found this piece of a ball
in the manger, and Pallid&#8217;s down on his side as
dead as Billy Kirby.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Peter Skerrett returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send your people away, Waddy,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Mr. Budlong, these gentlemen are friends. We
shall need their advice. Your wife and Mr. Belden
are missing. They probably went in the Providence
boat two hours ago.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>For a moment no one spoke. Poor Bud sat
staring, his face purple, unable for a breath to comprehend.
Then his colour faded, his face fell suddenly
into folds and wrinkles. He put down his
head and groaned.</p>

<p>Before anyone could find words of consolation, or
realise how powerless to console any words must be,
there came another knock at the door. It was
Figgins, looking more like a ticket-of-leave man
than ever. The bow in his legs seemed to have
increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;My master &#8217;as ran hoff without payin&#8217; me
hanythink,&#8221; said he, cringing to Mr. Waddy. &#8220;Hi
found them papers hamong &#8217;is traps,&#8221; he continued,
laying a packet on the table, &#8220;hand seein&#8217; as they
was marked with yer honour&#8217;s name, Hi thought yer
honour mout give me five dollars fer a savink of
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve been thieving as well as trying to
poison,&#8221; said Ira, as he opened the door. &#8220;Here,
boys,&#8221; he called to Chin Chin and Bowery, in the adjoining
room. &#8220;Lug this beggar off. We&#8217;ll have
him attended to to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi yi! All same!&#8221; shouted Chin Chin, pouncing
upon Figgins, and that worthy was dragged off
with a Chinaman at his hair and the Bowery Boy
playfully tapping him on the nob.</p>

<p>Mr. Waddy picked up the packet of papers, to toss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
it after Figgins, but held his hand, with a sudden
start of astonishment as his eye caught the indorsement.
He stared at it a moment, scarce believing
that he saw aright; a swift presentiment
shook him, turned him hot, cold&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, a little hoarsely, &#8220;I do not
desire to pry into Mr. Belden&#8217;s private papers, but
this parcel is indorsed in my own hand, or a hand
that seems my own, as relating to me. I shall take
the liberty, in your presence, of ascertaining the contents.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened them with trembling fingers: the
whole plot burst upon him, foul, damnable, unspeakably
vile.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; thought he. &#8220;They showed her
these&mdash;she could not doubt my own hand. And I
have wronged her all these fifteen years! Oh, how
I pardon her!&#8221;</p>

<p>His hands were trembling still; his eyes were
hot with tears&mdash;tears of joy, tears of thankfulness&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Old Budlong looked up, with a sudden jerk of the
head. His eyes, too, were wet and his hands tremulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, steadying his voice, which
would have broken, &#8220;I&#8217;m an old man, but I&#8217;ve
been a kind husband, and as devoted to my wife as I
knew how. I sometimes thought she was a little gay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
and it made me unhappy&mdash;but I was old and she
was young, and I never thwarted her. She has had
everything she wished, and, gentlemen, I loved her
like a wife and a daughter. She was a beautiful
woman, you know, and I found her very poor, the
daughter of one of my old cronies, and I put her
where she belonged, among splendid things. I have
never seen anything handsomer than she was, gentlemen,
and I was proud of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke of her as if she were dead, and other
lips were quivering, in sympathy with his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you have thought,&#8221; he went on, after
a moment, with a quiet dignity that was new to him
and very touching, &#8220;that I was too much away this
summer; but when we came back from Europe, she
asked me to take a few thousands she had inherited
from her uncle and operate with them. So I&#8217;ve been
at work for her all summer in that hot town. I paid
her over the profits last time I was down, in shares
of the Manhattan Bank, a good old stock, twenty-three
thousand dollars. I thought perhaps she&#8217;d
like to feel more independent of the old man. I felt
a little vain of the operation, gentlemen, and I said
to her, &#8216;You see, Betty dear, your old boy does understand
one thing, and that is how to make money
for you.&#8217; She actually cried at that, she did, gentlemen,
and said she was very sorry I&#8217;d been away so
much, working so hard, and she wished she was
good enough for me. That doesn&#8217;t look like a bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
woman,&#8221; he continued, wiping his eyes. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s bad,&mdash;not at heart, my friends,&mdash;but
you know I&#8217;m an old man and a little rough, perhaps,
and she didn&#8217;t like my being proud that I&#8217;d
come up from a deck-hand on a North River barge.
It was to please her that I stopped writing my name
Flirney and bought my new house and tried to
study French and went to Europe. But it was too
late&mdash;I was too old&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t change&mdash;though
God knows I tried!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry on Arabella&#8217;s account,&#8221; he added,
more calmly. &#8220;She&#8217;s an honest girl, and a pretty
girl, and a good girl, too, though I say it, and like
her own mother, when we lived down in Pearl
Street long ago. Now, nobody will speak to the
daughter of an old man whose wife has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And
the broken-hearted old gentleman stopped and
wiped his eyes again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! Peter Skerrett, lad,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;I know what you mean to say. I love you like a
son; but it&#8217;s no use. My name shall never bring its
disgrace upon anyone else.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he added, rising, &#8220;I thank you,
gentlemen, for your kind feeling and listening to my
childish talk. I&#8217;m an old man, you see; but there&#8217;s
some of the old stuff left in me still. I start to-morrow
morning and I&#8217;ll trail him&mdash;I&#8217;ll trail him
like an Injun. I&#8217;ve lived mostly in the city since I
was a boy, but I used to be pretty good with the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
King&#8217;s arm and I guess he&#8217;ll find I can hit the size of
a man yet. Good-night, gentlemen. Good-night,
Peter, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Budlong,&#8221; said Ira, seizing the old man&#8217;s
hand, &#8220;I will go with you. My revenge is older
than yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well out of Vanity Fair, Mr. Ira Waddy!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<span class="small">A VOYAGE OF UNKNOWN LENGTH</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE will always be a certain number of respectable,
but inexperienced and unattractive
men whose wives will prefer others more attractive
than their husbands, even to the point of infidelity.
The wronged husband, who is often not destitute of
embryonic manliness, inquires what he is to do,
when he is true and his wife is false?</p>

<p>&#8220;Look you, stranger! There is only one thing to
do. You must shoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Budlong did not seem any more like a withered
De Flournoy in the pursuit of the fugitives.
He was strangely alert, keen, skilful in seizing
every clew, but totally indifferent to all other interests.
In their long and dismal journeys by day
and night, he and Ira Waddy sat side by side; stern,
self-possessed, silent save on one single topic, and on
that speaking only rarely and of necessity. Travellers
for autumn pleasure, travellers returning gaily
from gay summerings, saw these two grave, iron
men, and were awed by their look of inflexible,
deadly purpose. There was a watchful meaning in
all their actions. Their monosyllables with each
other struck like thrusts of a dagger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>At Providence, the fugitives had disappeared.
There are many honest couples journeying at that
season, and it was impossible to distinguish the dishonest
one. Then, too, Belden&#8217;s dangerous facility
of handwriting made the various names they assumed
unrecognisable. He took this precaution
before he was aware of pursuit. He became aware
of it only by a chance. It was at one of the great
railroad centres, where lines of rail interlace each
other like a network of nerves. The train with
Belden and his companion was just quickening on
to speed when a coming train rumbled slowly into
the station. Belden was looking from a window
and divined why these stern men were leashed together.
He saw them and they him: it was a view
of a moment and roused them afresh to retrace their
steps in unflagging pursuit.</p>

<p>Belden grew very shaky after this. Fear is a
terribly wearing thing. With prostration of his
morale, physical feebleness began also to come. He
felt the consequences of his exhausting life. His
hand trembled. You would not have bet upon his
snuffing a candle with the pistol he carried. In fact,
you would have thought it quite unsafe that he
should have a pistol. He might shoot a bystander
or himself, as well as an assailant. He played too
much with that weapon with his nervous, trembling
fingers.</p>

<p>It was very soon discovered between him and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
partner that their flight was not a necessity of passion.
Each had made a convenience of the other,
and it was not long before they knew it with mutual
disgust. The <i>intriguante</i>, to give her the benefit of
all euphemism, found out what a ruined villain
she had hired for an escort: and she, in revenge,
made him understand her own good reasons for absence
before exposure. No very pleasant feeling,
then, between this pair&mdash;certainly not love&mdash;passion
exhausted&mdash;contempt, disgust, hatred growing&mdash;only
between them the cohesion of guilt, and now
of common terror. Chasing him was the punishment
of his last and of his first villainy and most he
dreaded the older vengeance of the younger man&mdash;that
had a black, looming weight of long accumulation,
and if it fell upon him, would fall with the
vigorous force of youth. Chasing her was love
changed, as she thought, to hate; trust to contempt;
faith outraged; pride shattered; a man bitterly pursuing
a woman who had been false to him; a worthy
husband, an unworthy wife: and besides this, the
companion of this pursuit was the person whom she
would least wish to encounter as the representative
of that public scorn she had desperately fled to escape.
All this stole the bloom and freshness from
the cheeks of the late wife of Mr. Budlong; her
flourishing days were past; her withering days had
come; and, alas! for her there would be no second
spring to follow winter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>Flight is fleet by night and day. Ways of dashing
speed traverse half the continent. Flight is independent
and baffling with labyrinthine choices. Pursuit
must slowly seize its clew and follow cautiously.</p>

<p>In the early confidences of their departure, Belden
had learnt the extent of his partner&#8217;s resources&mdash;the
twenty-three thousand dollars, profits of Mr.
Budlong&#8217;s summer toils.</p>

<p>&#8220;A neat capital,&#8221; thought Belden, &#8220;for a new
country. When I get hold of it, I&#8217;ll let her slide,
and after this blows over, I can buy back into society.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he made for the West, hiding his trail and
covering his campfires. But a coward dread permanently
overcame him, and he often felt with
trembling fingers for his pistol and started when
coachmen pointed at him with threatening whips of
would-be invitation, or hotel clerks asked his name.</p>

<p>All penal laws are founded upon vengeance. The
passion of revenge is necessary for protection. But
it is ugly, like the crimes and wrongs that awake it.
Mr. Waddy, sternly intent upon the punishment of a
scoundrel, whom society could not fully punish, repelled
all softer thoughts. He concentrated the
whole ire of his nature on this one object. He
would not think tenderly of his old love, perhaps
still his faithful love. He forgave her for the wrong
of his exile, for her imagined falseness: it was inevitable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
But what she had become; whether she
still remembered him with loving bitterness, with
sorrowful despair of disappointed love like his own&mdash;this
he knew not, would not think of. He would
not perplex himself with tender uncertainties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vengeance, vengeance,&#8221; said his fifteen dreary
years. But would she, if she still remembered him
kindly, receive him to the old friendship if he came
with blood on his hands? He swept away the
thought; he saw before him a duty to society.</p>

<p>On, on, silent pair! wronged husband, wronged
lover. On, deadly thoughts! voiceless purposes!
Fate goes with you and Vengeance and Death!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An ugly muddy ditch, the Mississippi, divides our
continent with its perpendicular line of utility. It
is not a stream that one used to vivifying seaside
waters, or the clear sparkle of New England brooks,
would wish to drown in, if drowning was his
choice.</p>

<p>The vehicles that run upon this muddy pathway
are worthy of its ugliness. At night, majestical
moving illuminations, by day they are structures of
many-tiered deformity. One of these monsters, a
favourite, <i>Spitfire No. 5</i>, was to start one sultry
afternoon of this same September for up the river.
<i>Spitfire No. 5</i> wore over her pilot-house the gilded
elk-horns of victory; all the passengers were sure of
being speedily borne to their destination.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>As the boat backed out into the stream and hung
there a moment motionless, two men, who had been
a little belated in searching for someone they wished
to find at the different hotels, pushed off in a row-boat
and overtook the steamer. The strong current
drifted them out of their course and they boarded
the boat unobserved, on her starboard side, away
from the town.</p>

<p>Mr. Saunders and his lady, a handsome but
rather faded person, had remained in their stateroom
until the <i>Spitfire</i> was fairly out in the stream.
The rail was not yet put up at the forward gangway,
and Mr. Saunders stood there, looking at the
crowded levee and its hundred monster steamboats,
including <i>Spitfires</i> from 1 to 10. He was in a moment&#8217;s
pause between two journeys. One long journey
was over; another was about to begin. How
long he could not say; voyages on Mississippi steamboats
may be short, may be lingering. All voyages
are uncertain. Fatal accidents often happen.
Mr. Saunders, so he entered his name on the
books, was just beginning a journey of unknown
length.</p>

<p>A greenish gardener from near Boston, emigrating
to Iowa, who thought he had seen Mr. Saunders
somewhere before, was a little frightened at that
gentleman&#8217;s brutal reply to an innocent question, and
observing him nervously fingering at something like
a cocked pistol in his breast pocket, shrank back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>&#8220;A border ruffian,&mdash;perhaps Atchison or Titus,&#8221;
he said to himself, and thanked his stars for his fortunate
escape.</p>

<p>The two belated passengers had tumbled in
astern and now came forward, with carpet-bag in
hand, to ascend the staircase to the saloon. As
they passed the gangway, still open, the man with
the cocked pistol turned, and they met face to
face.</p>

<p>They dropped their luggage and stepped toward
him. But he was too quick for them. The nervous,
trembling fingers clutched at the cocked pistol; there
was a report; he staggered back with his hand at
his breast and fell through the open gangway. The
great wheel smote upon the muddy current and
tossed up carelessly in the turbid foam behind a dead
man, with forehead mangled by a paddle-stroke&mdash;a
dead man, going on a voyage of unknown length
along the busy river.</p>

<p>Among the people who rushed aft at the cry of
horror that arose was the woman registered as the
lady of Mr. Saunders. She saw the body come
whirling slowly by and lazily drown away. She
sank upon a seat, and was there still in stony, speechless
dread, when she felt a hand laid not unkindly on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betty, we meant to kill him,&#8221; said Mr. Budlong;
&#8220;perhaps it would have been murder. We were
spared the final crime. I&#8217;m sorry for you, Betty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
and forgive you from my heart,&#8221; and the poor old
gentleman, worn out, heartbroken, his life no longer
sustained by the tense vigour of a single purpose&mdash;poor
old Bud drooped and fell blasted, a paralytic,
at the feet of his unfaithful wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<span class="small">MR. WADDY ACCOMPLISHES HIS RETURN</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">OPPOSITE Mr. Belden&#8217;s house, which, about
the time of his departure from Newport,
passed into the hands of his creditors, was the old
country place of the Janeway family. It was still in
the possession of the representative of that family,
under a different name.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Janeway, though a proud and, as it
finally appeared, a bad man, remembered the inherited
debt of his family to the Waddys, and felt
some aristocratic vanity in his tutelage of the young
Ira, our hero. A close intimacy of childish friendship
grew up between Mr. Janeway&#8217;s only child and
daughter, Mary, and his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Young
Horace Belden, the handsome son of the next neighbour,
Mr. Belden, the great merchant, was also a
companion of Miss Janeway; in fact, the parents of
these two destined them for each other. Adjoining
estates, large fortunes, good blood, beauty on both
sides&mdash;the two fathers thought the match a perfect
one and the young people were taught to consider it
settled. Something unsettled it. Horace Belden
unsettled it by being himself and that self was, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
early years, not a noble one. He unsettled it in the
mind of Mrs. Janeway, as he grew older, by what he
called his flirtation with Sally Bishop, a flaunting
girl, daughter of Mr. Janeway&#8217;s ex-coachman.</p>

<p>Belden, however, remained very devoted to Miss
Janeway. He loved her as much as was in his nature,
and his pride was fully engaged in winning
her, the great match of the day and his by long convention.
As he grew older and no better, he began
to consider this pure young lady as his bond to purer
life and mentally to throw on her the responsibility
of his future intended reformation. She must become
his, or he would revenge his disappointment,
his wounded pride, and his failure of her help and
control in his proposed change of character, upon
her, upon society, and upon himself.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Mr. Janeway began to
discover that too great an intimacy was growing up
between his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Ira Waddy, and his daughter.
It was well enough while they were children, but the
son of a shopkeeper of Dullish Court, and clerk in
the counting-house of Belden &amp; Co., was not for
Miss Janeway, beauty, aristocrat, heiress, belle.
So Mr. Janeway was very distant to Ira Waddy,
now a handsome, high-spirited, quick-tempered, energetic
young man, full of generous candour and
kindliness and gratitude to all the Janeways for the
happy and refining influences of their society and
their world. The ladies always took Ira&#8217;s part, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
this only confirmed Mr. Janeway in his purpose of
making him uncomfortable. At last, this gentleman,
finding one day Ira t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Mary, quarrelled
with him openly, and finally forbade him the house,
speaking very ill of his character. It may have been
too late. Whatever had passed between Ira and
Miss Janeway that might fitly be known, Belden
knew. Ira Waddy, trustful as he was true, had
given his unreserved confidence to Belden, friend of
the lady and of him.</p>

<p>Miss Janeway was twenty, two years younger
than Ira Waddy, when he, suddenly, one July,
fifteen years before this Return of his, went off to
those regions where his namesake river rolls. Five
years after, the crash in her father&#8217;s fortunes came.
He became an utterly dishonoured man, financially,
morally. He could bear his guilt; not its discovery.
He died, as it was best he should. His daughter,
belle and reputed heiress, did as scores of young
ladies of New England have done: she became a
teacher in a school and at last a governess. By-and-by,
an old lover of Mrs. Janeway arrived. His
constancy and devotion through ill-report touched
the lady, and she consented to share her distress and
her poverty with his humble fortunes at the West.
They did not long remain humble. Where he owned
a farm, there a town sprouted; where a lot, thither
came a railroad demanding a station. His hillsides
became stone quarries; his fields, coal mines. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
wealth swelled like a fungus of the forest. His wife
died and he soon followed her, fairly bullied out of
existence by his own stupendous success. His whole
property he bequeathed to his step-daughter on the
one condition of a change of name. He thus, as it
were, ceased to be childless and avoided contributing
to the prosperity of his former rival&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Janeway, the governess of Clara and
Diana and Julia Wilkes, became Miss Mary Sullivan,
the woman of fortune. She repurchased the
Janeway estate, the house where her happy youth
had passed, and it was there she had received
Diana.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cecilia Tootler, in combination with Miss
Sullivan, managed the charities of their neighbourhood.
Miss Sullivan, having no incumbrance of a
Thomas Tootler and Cecilia, junior, could superintend
also those preventive charities, the schools,
utilising here her own experience. In the sick-room
or the home of the poor, the sorrowful, or the guilty,
these two ladies made themselves welcome. The
elder with her deep experience had learnt what others
need of wisest sympathy, and the younger came like
a gleam of cheerful, untarnished hope.</p>

<p>Cecilia in vain endeavoured to persuade her friend
to see Sally Bishop.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is dying,&#8221; said Cecilia. &#8220;She is punished
for whatever wrong she may have done. But
peace of mind is totally denied her. Remorse is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
killing her faster than her disease. All my consolations
are vain. She needs someone better and
wiser than I. She needs you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she asked for me?&#8221; said Miss Sullivan.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not to see you,&#8221; replied Cecilia, &#8220;but she
speaks of you often with great distress. Do come
and see her&mdash;perhaps she may have some explanation
to give. Mary, Mary, what is this mystery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Cecilia,&#8221; answered Mary, &#8220;it is not because
Sally Bishop has been a very bad woman that
I avoid her. But she was long ago the willing and
exulting means of proving to me not only her own
viciousness, but the foul treachery and utterly coarse,
detestable baseness of heart and mind of one I
trusted as I now trust only God. It was right that I
should know the truth, but I must feel a personal
horror of a woman whose ill-omened duty it was to
tell me to despair and lose my faith and my happiness
together. And Sally Bishop did her duty as if
it were a privilege and beheld my misery with vile,
vulgar, shameless triumph. I abhor the thought
of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cecilia said nothing more at the time&mdash;indeed,
there was nothing she could say. But as the days
passed, Sally Bishop grew hopelessly worse, and her
father kept himself boozy all the while. Horse-jockeys,
pro-slavery judges, gamblers, and collectors
of democratic customs sometimes love their
families.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>Miss Sullivan had just received Clara&#8217;s summons
to Diana&#8217;s bed of death; she was preparing to
go that evening, when Mrs. Tootler drove up in
haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sally Bishop cannot live through the day,&#8221; said
the lady. &#8220;She demands to see you. She has a confession
to make. Coming death has absolved her
from a pledge of wicked secrecy.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, by the deathbed, Miss Sullivan, whose
best and brightest hopes had been destroyed by the
infamy of this poor, dying wretch, listened to her
confession and pitied and pardoned her. Sally
Bishop, vain and immodest, had nursed in her heart
against young Ira Waddy the bitter spite of a shameless
woman scorned. Belden, who was her first instructor
in shamelessness, discovered this, and used
his power to delude her into the joint revenge of
the letters. Oh, what carefully villainous letters
Belden made of them! how brutally treacherous!
how vile! Sally Bishop took the correspondence in
Ira Waddy&#8217;s writing to Miss Janeway.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you heiress, you great lady,
that have stolen away my lover, because you are
rich, and are engaged to him without your father&#8217;s
knowledge, see what letters he used to write to me
and how he spoke of you and his interviews with
you. He ruined me because I loved him, and made
of me what you see in my own letters, and I was
willing that he should marry you because he always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
promised that I should be first. But now he is trying
to get rid of me. He finds me in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Janeway read the letters as one reads a fascinating
tale of horror. There could be no doubt of
them; hand, style, circumstances&mdash;it was inevitable
they were his. Poor, innocent girl&mdash;she would
afterward see the world and its treacheries, but
never any so base as this. Her lover, with her
maiden kiss upon his lips&mdash;agony! to leave her and
write this.</p>

<p>What could she do? Die&mdash;and all the lovely
sounds of nature that she had learned to love with
him from childhood said to her, &#8220;die drearily.&#8221;
But it was dreary life that was to be hers and slow-coming
patience in her desolate retirement from the
world, and experience of domestic shame and
shame-crushed life and disgraced death in a darkened
household and strict poverty and unaccustomed
labour, and by all this a character forming&mdash;another
woman than the gay, impetuous, proud, loving
girl of days flattered by fulness of prosperity. Another
in all but loving, and now she must love no
more one she could not forget, who had fled when
he learnt from her cold letter that his falseness to
her was known, she could not sully her pen to tell
him how, nor she, a pure woman, hear or speak or
think of him more. Love!&mdash;what could she ever
love again with anything more than quiet interest&mdash;she
the pale schoolmistress, lonely as that betrothed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
Mary of the first Ira Waddy, preserver of her grandfather
at Bunker Hill?</p>

<p>So this pale schoolmistress was calm and patient
and learnt by her own wrong (the only teaching) to
hate all wrong and to know it under any specious
guise of quietism; and having something much to
pardon in her own life, she grew to pardon other
ruined lives. She saw how easily sorrow may become
despair. A nobler woman she was becoming
all these years, but still solitary; loving the many,
but lonely of the few to love, until she found in
Clara and Diana worthy objects of the closest and
tenderest affection.</p>

<p>And now, almost forgetting the wrong this poor
dying victim of Belden&#8217;s villainy had done her, in
the sweet pleasure of forgiveness and the dear passion
of reviving love, Miss Sullivan must go to the
deathbed of her she called daughter, whose sad
story she knew. She called Cecilia and resigned to
her the dying woman, now at peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you now, dear Cecilia,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I must go. I must think of what I have heard.
Only, believe me, she has made me happy, happy
again as a child. God forgive her, as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to her house by the same paths where
her brilliant youth had walked; through the gate
where she had so often stood for moments of the shy
and lingering tenderness of parting; under the ancient
elms whose gracefulness had drooped over her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
and her exiled lover in many a moonlight of pensive
hopefulness. The glory had come back again. The
freshness of youth and everlasting springtime was
over all the world. She need never again force herself
to say that it was good and beautiful; a brightness
of transfiguring hope went before her and revealed
beneath the drifting away of grey dimness
and tearful mists the light of beauty unchangeable
and goodness infinite.</p>

<p>Miss Sullivan was to depart on the same journey
that Diana had made with such hopeful joy of
heart. She had one little act of preparation to do.
She took the Testament, her own childish gift,
which she had found still the talisman of life to a
drowning man, and pressing it very tenderly to her
lips, she hung it about her neck. Its touch sent a
warm thrill of longing to her fondly waking heart
and, with the thrill, a blush shot youth again through
her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;God willed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I who had driven
him into exile should be there at his return. How
could I not know and feel that one who still in
drowning and in death clung to this precious talisman
of purest Life, could never be what lies had
made me deem him?&#8221;</p>

<p>And she went on her journey to be with sorrow
and death; but with a joy that no chance of any
dying, to-day or to-morrow, could take away. Her
joy was of eternity, for she had learnt that love such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
as hers can never be born and grow and be, unless it
is founded upon fullest truth and worthiest worth
and most honourable honour in the heart of him she
loved&mdash;and truth and worth and honour are imperishable
and eternal.</p>

<p>In those weeks, while Mr. Waddy was chasing
sullenly to overtake revenge, Diana was dying
among her tender friends&mdash;Clara, forlorn of her
noble sister, for whom earth was not found worthy;
Dunstan, Endymion, watching, while night after
night, the deity of his life and of his heaven fading,
perished slowly away until, one violet dawn, she
was not. But the sun came up and shone upon his
path of manly duty, and he will bravely walk therein,
conscious that a beautiful spirit is near him and will
never vanish from the sky of his visions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ira Waddy was on his return from the West.
Revenge had passed away from his heart. He had
seen his enemy die horribly, but not by his hand.
Death had risen up terribly between him and murder.
Merited revenge had overtaken the guilty, but
had not chosen him for executioner. And as he
turned his face again eastward, he was glad for
this&mdash;glad that the weight of blood, which he would
have assumed unshrinkingly, was spared him.
With this storm of deadly-meaning pursuit, with its
dark sullenness, unillumined until the final thunder-bolt
fell&mdash;with this closing crash, all the long accumulating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
bitterness passed away from Ira
Waddy&#8217;s nature. Heaven was clear and cloudless
over him. All mysteries were swept away. It was
a new dawn, and a glorious. And he hastened eastward,
every moment, long as it seemed, bringing
him nearer, nearer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He had left poor Budlong under the wise and
kind protection of Peter Skerrett. And there was
another, a woman, who would not leave the old
man&#8217;s bedside, but was there a silent, humble nurse,
often bursting into bitter tears, when he inarticulately
murmured to her feeble words, which only her
quickened ears could construe into intentions of forgiveness.</p>

<p>To arrange Mr. Budlong&#8217;s affairs at Newport,
and his own, Mr. Waddy passed that way on his
eastward journey. He arrived, as is usual, in the
fresh morning. It was still early autumn, but
Vanity Fair had struck its booths, taken down its
<i>&eacute;talage</i>, and gone into winter quarters. The season
had ended sadly; everyone was saddened for Diana.
Her inspiring beauty had been the brilliant presence
that made this summer brighter than any remembered
summer. There was many a dry old beau
who, stimulated by the thought of her into a brief
belief that he could be young, ardent, frank, and
brave again, found himself looking with moistened
eyes at the places she would illumine no more and
feeling that a glory and a hope had passed away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>It would have all seemed rather dreary to Mr.
Waddy, walking there alone, but no desolate spot
of desert earth is dreary to a man who feels the
warmth of his own happiness making gardens sun-shiny,
roseate, wherever he treads. Not drearily,
then, but full of sad sympathy, Mr. Waddy went
toward the house of his gentle kinsman and friend;
thinking most of Clara, now so widowed by the
death of one dearer than a sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will ask her who is this Miss Sullivan, whom
Granby spoke of as their governess,&#8221; he said, because
his heart was full of gratitude. &#8220;Perhaps it
may prove that she and my kind friend are one, and
I can discover her residence and thank her suitably.&#8221;</p>

<p>He avoided the main entrance to his kinsman&#8217;s
grounds, and took a narrow, winding path, hedged
with rich, close growth of arbor vit&aelig;. At last he
reached the house, and passed into the library to
wait. As he entered, a graceful figure in black disappeared
through another door. She had evidently
been sitting solitary reading, for the leaves of a little
book on the table were still fluttering. It had a
look somehow familiar. Mr. Waddy stepped toward
the table and picked it up.</p>

<p>It was his own Testament, gift of childish friendship
confirmed by after love, companion of all his
better moments, and talisman of safety to his wide-wandering,
bewildered life.</p>

<p>He raised the time-worn, tear-worn, wave-worn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
volume to his lips and, sitting down, covered his face
with his hands, and yielded for a moment to the
need of happy tears.</p>

<p>He was aroused by a gentle touch upon his
shoulder. He turned. It was his old love; his love
unforgotten, through all those years of desolate
exile, and now&mdash;now, his own love forever.</p>

<p>And this was the full Return of Mr. Ira Waddy.</p>

<p>Most readers will class this as a ghost story, but it is so plausibly
told that many may, like one of the chief characters, think it might all be
explained by the natural causes after all. It tells the astonishing adventures
of three American engineers, excavating in the heart of an Egyptian
desert. The book is decorated with pictures of the desert at sunset and
in the starlight, and there are initials and a cover in the Egyptian style.</p>

<p><i>N. Y. Times Review</i>:&mdash;&#8220;Remarkably well written, with style and
discretion and feeling for effect. You must read the tale to know
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>N. Y. Globe</i>:&mdash;&#8220;To strike a note of weird horror, and to sustain that
note page after page, without once falling away from the original key,
is a talent not given to a great number of authors.... A vividness
that makes it difficult to banish the picture from your memory for many
a day after reading it.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>N. Y. Sun</i>:&mdash;&#8220;An uncanny story of the victory of the inscrutable East
over three American engineers ... a well-written and readable story.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Public Opinion</i>:&mdash;&#8220;A weird tale unusually well told.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Independent</i>:&mdash;&#8220;A new kind of thrill.... We warn all who have
nerves and nightmares against reading this book.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Chicago Record-Herald</i>:&mdash;&#8220;Fascinating ... the author&#8217;s art is
such that one is carried away by the romance.... Told with consummate
skill.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Boston Beacon</i>:&mdash;&#8220;A tale of mystery and cumulative interest continuously
absorbing ... two decorations in color, highly suggestive of
the desert region where the occult action of the tale takes place.&#8221;</p>

<p>A picture of the soul of a genius, na&iuml;vely unconscious of the
limitations imposed upon life by some of us who are not geniuses&mdash;and
probably by some who are. A vivid picture is given of
the grinding poverty of his youth on the Hungarian farm, his
struggle for education, and his strange success. His last entries
are touching, and somewhat in the nature of a surprise.
The book runs over with marked humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much of that exquisite egotism, the huge, artistic Me and
the tiny universe, the gluttony of the emotions, of the whole
peculiar compound of hysteria, inspiration, vanity, insight and
fidgets which goes to make up that delightful but somewhat
rickety thing which we call the artistic temperament is reproduced....
&#8216;The Diary of a Musician&#8217; does what most actual
diaries fail to do&mdash;writes down a man in full. It is an entertaining
study in na&iuml;vet&eacute; and nerves, art-pains and genius-consciousness.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bookman.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Especially interesting; ... many amusing situations.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Public
Opinion.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the book is inimitable.... That marvelous,
appalling, mad thing named genius, at once the despair
of those who do and those who do not possess it, is here pictured
with extraordinary fascination and power.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Uncommon power distinguishes it; ... a curiously
interesting book.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A work of unusual character; ... entirely original in its
scope.&#8221;&mdash;<i>San Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Take it how you will, &#8216;The Diary of a Musician&#8217; is
wonderful.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Lucille Wetherell in Powers&#8217; Reviews of the
New Books, Minneapolis.</i></p>
